    "content": "When Darcus Beese first heard Amy Winehouse sing – way before her Grammy-winning 2006 album Back to Black and long before her battles with addiction became tabloid fodder – he immediately saw her potential.He was the executive responsible for signing artists to Island Records and hers was a signature he needed.“When Amy came along and I heard that voice, I could tie it back to the voices of yesteryear,” he says. “I felt like I was listening to a throwback record, whether it was Billie Holiday or Dinah Washington.“But she had an infusion of hip-hop, and she had a lyrical take that was very modern and reflective of that time.”He sighs.“She was ahead of her time.”As executive responsible for signing artists to Island Records, Darcus Beese knew Amy Winehouse was “ahead of her time”.Sitting in his London home, 14 years to the day since Winehouse died aged 27, Beese, who includes Jessie J, Mumford & Sons and Dizzee Rascal among his signings, can draw a line from the turmoil and tragedy of her final years to the way he works with artists today.“Mental health is at the forefront of the conversation. And you ask questions that you never used to ask, and that people would have been afraid to answer because they’d have thought, I’ll lose my job. It’s given people the ability to authentically be themselves.”Beese was born in 1969 and raised in Fulham, West London. His activist parents – Barbara Beese and Darcus Howe – were prominent in the British Black Panthers movement."

I’m 21 and in the passenger seat of a friend’s old Daewoo, taking turns to drive it up to Byron for that year’s Falls Festival.It’s a stinking hot afternoon. The windows are down. We are approaching turn-offs for Forster and holding mild concerns about how our Korean chariot will handle the rest of the long trip. Its tiny back seat is packed to the brim – bags, tents, and another friend stuffed in among them. We should have left earlier, we say. Tired and sweaty, morale is sliding.Then, we hear the violins.Pop duo The Veronicas’ ranked third in yesterday’s Hottest 100 Australian Songs countdown.When Untouched by The Veronicas ranked third in the Hottest 100 Australian Songs Countdown, ahead of more obviously “Aussie” classics like Beds are Burning, You’re the Voice or Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again, it took some by surprise.But, as someone who has scream-sung every word – including the harmonies – to the 2007 song while driving up the highway to a music festival, the placing could not have made more sense.After reaching number two on the ARIA chart as the first single off their second album, Untouched has emerged as Brisbane-raised duo Jess and Lisa Origliasso’s most enduring track.LoadingThe song is loved by the LGBTQ community, particularly as Jess identifies as queer. As Triple J has reported, the sisters introduced Untouched as “the national gay anthem” to a crowd of expats at Los Angeles Pride in 2019.And, on any weekend across the country, Untouched will bring the girls to a wedding dance floor. Making it through the song’s four minutes and 14 seconds is an endurance event: memory, stamina and diction are all required to keep singing the right – “or wrong, or wrong or right” – repetitious words at 177 beats per minute."

    "content": "London: When Ozzy Osbourne was an advice columnist for The Sunday Times of London, he detailed what he wanted his funeral to be like. The heavy metal singer and reality TV star wrote in 2011 that he hoped the eventual ceremony would be “a celebration, not a mope-fest” and preferably include some pranks – “maybe the sound of knocking inside the coffin”.On Tuesday, the City Council in the singer’s hometown, Birmingham, England, said that a celebration of the singer’s life would be held there on Wednesday, with a hearse carrying his body through Birmingham’s main street accompanied by a brass band.Ozzy Osbourne in full flight in 2022. He died last week aged 76.Credit: APThe procession will culminate at the Black Sabbath Bench, a tourist attraction dedicated to Osbourne and his bandmates in the heavy metal group that has become a focal point for fan tributes since Osbourne’s death at age 76 last week.Zafar Iqbal, Birmingham’s lord mayor, an honorary position, said in a statement that “it was important to the city that we support a fitting, dignified tribute ahead of a private family funeral. We know how much this moment will mean to his fans.”The Osbourne family is covering all costs related to the procession, the lord mayor added. Details of a private family funeral have not yet been announced. A spokesperson for the Osbourne family did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Tributes for Ozzy Osbourne left at Black Sabbath Bench in Birmingham in the wake of his death. Credit: Getty ImagesThe procession will take place just weeks after Osbourne performed his last show, Back to the Beginning, an all-day festival on July 5 that celebrated the singer’s life and music. Held at a soccer stadium in Birmingham, the concert also served as a momentary reunion for Black Sabbath, the band that he and three other musicians formed in 1968.Heavy metal and rock bands including Metallica, Slayer and Guns N’ Roses also played sets and covered Black Sabbath songs at that event, and video tributes from celebrities such as Elton John and Dolly Parton were broadcast on large screens at the side of the stage.As Black Sabbath’s lead singer, Osbourne was widely considered a forefather of heavy metal music, though he achieved more commercial success in the 1980s and 1990s as a solo musician after his bandmates fired him."

Though he will, of course, be remembered for his Hall of Fame-worthy heavy metal talent, the former Black Sabbath frontman will also go down in history for a particular moment he shared with a dead bat in Iowa.You never really knew what Ozzy Osbourne was going to do on-stage.Credit: Alamy Stock PhotoDuring Osbourne’s Diary of a Madman tour in January 1982, the demon-invoking musician bit the head off what he thought was a fake, rubber bat that had been thrown on stage at Des Moines’ Veterans Memorial Auditorium (now the Iowa Events Centre). However, as soon as he noticed the blood seeping out of the fanged mammal, he realised it was a dead, but very real, bat.Speaking in the 2020 documentary The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, he recalled thinking it was fake when it was thrown towards him.Loading“I picked it up, put it in my mouth, crunched down, bit into it, being the clown that I am,” he said. “I had to go to the hospital afterward and get rabies shots, one in each rear.”It was later revealed that Mark Neal, an Osbourne fan who had been at the Des Moines concert that night, had allegedly thrown the animal on stage. According to an Iowa-based report, Neal said the bat was already dead before the show. However, Osbourne later said he felt the bat’s head “twitch” in his mouth.Osbourne had already earned the “Prince of Darkness” moniker during his time as the lead vocalist for Black Sabbath, but the bat incident certainly cemented his anarchic, unpredictable brand, and launched him into mainstream fame.He went on to appear on popular talk shows such as The David Letterman Show to explain why he bit the animal, and even sold plush toy bats with detachable heads as merchandise. From there, Osbourne continued to leverage his more mainstream stardom, but it arguably reached a peak in 2002 when he and his family launched The Osbournes, one of MTV’s first reality television shows. Its first season was cited as the most-viewed series ever on MTV, attracting as many as 8 million viewers in one airing."

But that may be about to change.ACP is one of four artists selected for this year’s GRID series, a six-month development program aimed at boosting emerging talent from outer suburban and regional areas of Australia – areas historically under-resourced and overlooked by the music industry.The selected artists on this year’s GRID (from left to right): Martha, Jordz, Kiid Koda and ACP.Credit: Simon Schluter“It feels like a full-circle moment,” ACP says. “I’ll get to learn so much about the industry, and get to work with so many people – award-winners and teams with all these accolades on top of them … I want to see where my name can go.”Following a successful 2024 program in Geelong, this year’s GRID focuses on South-East Melbourne talent, including ACP and fellow emerging artists Martha, Kiid Koda and Jordz. The four musicians will each be paired with an industry professional who will teach them the business – which ACP says is rife with “gatekeeping” – and support them as they produce singles, film their own documentary narrative and perform live.The opportunity to be connected with someone embedded in the industry is invaluable for ACP, whose local area of Ashwood lacks the infrastructure – such as studio recording spaces – and open networks to help thrust young, talented people into the big leagues.“The music industry can be a beautiful wreck sometimes,” he says. “Getting yourself and your music out there, it’s a beautiful cycle. But it can also be delayed by people who don’t want to help others.”Martha Kulang, who goes by Martha, experienced this first-hand when beginning her music career. The 25-year-old Narre Warren local – who traverses several genres such as Afro R&B, dancehall and rap – says a lack of networks and resources dampen an artist’s confidence."

Credit: APThe SexyBack singer, who described himself as a private person, wrote that he considered ending the tour when diagnosed but that he “decided the joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I’m so glad I kept going.”Lyme disease is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, also known as deer ticks. It can cause flu-like conditions, neurological problems, joint pain and other symptoms. In the vast majority of cases, Lyme disease is successfully treated with antibiotics.“I honestly don’t know what my future is onstage, but I’ll always cherish this run! And all of them before! It’s been the stuff of legend for me,” Timberlake wrote.Timberlake cancelled and postponed numerous shows throughout the tour’s run, citing health issues including bronchitis and laryngitis. Six of his US shows were postponed from October and November to February, the singer announced on Instagram. Timberlake ultimately cancelled the last show of the US leg of the tour in Ohio due to the flu in February. He has also been widely criticised for his performances during the tour.Representatives for Timberlake did not immediately respond to the Associated Press’ request for comment.Timberlake pleaded guilty to driving while impaired in New York’s Hamptons in 2024. As part of his plea deal, the singer gave a public safety announcement in September, urging drivers not to get behind the wheel after drinking."

Ninajirachi, Australia’s best underground DJ, releases her most personal statement yet. By Robert Moran Ninajirachi, aka Nina Wilson, has become one of Australia’s most innovative and influential electronic artists. Credit: Steven Siewert Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Ninajirachi still remembers that tenth-grade assessment in her high school music class. The assignment was simple: compose a piece of instrumental music. By then she was well versed in dance music production – with the help of YouTube tutorials, she’d already taught herself how to make songs in FL Studio, which she’d got for her 14th birthday (she’d saved up for years and her parents gave her the final bit of cash as a gift). Understandably, her confidence was high. “I knew my way around a DAW [digital audio workstation], so I was like, ‘I can do this, this is what I’m good at!’” she recalls. “So I made this cool thing using presets and I handed it in like, ‘I killed that, no one’s gonna have anything as good as that.’” It did not go well. “I got back this really shit mark! The feedback was that I had used a violin preset and a violin can’t physically play what I put in. I was like, ‘Oh OK, I see that we’re not on the same page here.’” As origin stories go, it couldn’t be more precise: the electronic artist set on her path after challenging the possibilities of traditional music. “That’s the thing, I didn’t even care,” the 25-year-old DJ and producer says. “They had wanted us to compose for a real instrument, but I was on a different wavelength already.” Ninajirachi, real name Nina Wilson, is posing in between claw machines at games arcade Koko, looking at home in its futuristic Blade Runner glow. Her blunt red fringe pokes from under her black hoodie, which she removes to reveal an oversized shirt with the slogan “I wanna f--- my computer”, a provocative rendering of the title – and thematic drive – of her new album, I Love My Computer. “That was a voice memo I had from early 2024,” Wilson says, laughing. “I had just finished making something that sounded really good, and I was thinking about those memes that are like, ‘Listening to music isn’t enough, I need to f--- the song.’” Coming almost a decade after her first single as Ninajirachi (her moniker is a portmanteau of her first name and Jirachi, her favourite Pokemon, a plush version of which hangs from her handbag), and having built a reputation as one of Australia’s most esteemed and idiosyncratic electronic artists, the album is somehow Wilson’s debut full-length. “I guess I just didn’t feel like it until now,” she says. “Maybe it would have been good for my career to put out an album five years ago, but I just didn’t have the vision or the idea for it until now.” Across its 12 noisy and affecting tracks, Wilson charts a life entwined with computers and the internet and the way “computer music” cracked her world open. On the bouncy highlight iPod Touch, she sings about her teenage years growing up in the Central Coast’s beachside Kincumber, and the fantasy world she conjured catching the 64 bus to school and back, her headphones blaring the warped sounds of Rustie and Yung Lean, artists she was discovering on SoundCloud. Like an evocative haiku (“It sounds like iPod Touch, yellow Pikachu case/FL Studio free download in my search history/Hidden underneath my pillow ’cause I should be asleep,” she sings), iPod Touch also outlines Wilson’s online and musical initiation. She was watching a YouTube tutorial on how to tie-dye denim shorts when the song playing in the video’s background undid her. It was, as she later found out, French DJ Madeon’s viral Pop Culture (Live Mashup). “I was like, ‘Oh my god, what is this?’” Wilson recalls. “I had never heard anything like it. It felt like someone had given me crack. I just wanted to know how it was made.” “Maybe it would have been good for my career to put out an album five years ago, but I just didn’t have the vision or the idea for it until now,” says Ninajirachi.Credit: Steven Siewert Growing up on the Central Coast, loving dance music wasn’t a normal teenage phase. “It was mostly skater music, beach music – that was what most of my friends were into. They didn’t really like what I was listening to; they thought I’d gone down the rabbit hole,” she says, with a laugh. Even so, Wilson says she felt primed for a career in electronic music. Her mum, who worked primarily in homoeopathy and remedial massage when Wilson was growing up, and her dad, a tradie, were ex-ravers. Mum, who lived in London in the ’90s, even frequented Ministry of Sound and stockpiled the label’s CDs. By the time Wilson finished high school, she’d already been named a finalist in triple j’s Unearthed High and was booking gigs; her parents were instantly supportive. “Neither of them went to uni so they were like, ‘As long as you are making your own money and working hard, we don’t care, go give it a go,’” says Wilson. Since she was 17 and still underage, they’d chaperone her to gigs that generally started after 11pm. “One time I had a gig and my dad came in his pyjamas and flip-flops, and he got asked to leave the venue because he didn’t have the right clothes or shoes,” Wilson says. “I felt like an undercover agent, like no one knows I’m underage and my dad’s not even in the venue. I loved it, it felt like a very dangerous lifestyle.” It’s an odd thing to attempt to describe Ninajirachi’s otherworldly sound; you find yourself turning to nonsense like “scree”, “scronk”, “grunch” and “glang” to try to convey her off-kilter sonic madness. The drums on CSIRAC, for example – a track named for the first computer to ever play music, now housed at Scienceworks in Melbourne – recall pots and pans tumbling around a washing machine. Closer All at Once is glitched-out subterranean techno filled with cartoon boings, clatters and laser bursts, an intricate symphony of noise. “I love novelty and surprise, and I’m just always trying to get as close to that feeling of when I first heard stuff like that,” she says. “I’m never trying to reinvent the wheel because that’s just a crazy goal to have. I just want to make something that impresses me or makes me happy.” After segueing from simple loops on GarageBand as a kid, Wilson’s early releases, including her first EP, 2019’s Lapland, were made using FL Studio, before she switched to Ableton. “A lot of it is, like, re-sampling,” Wilson explains of her process. “If I synthesise something and then re-record it to audio and then do something to that and re-record it to audio again, it becomes this big, long recording of rubbish that I’ll then sift through. And then it’s like patchwork or collage, getting all the prettiest scraps and putting them together.” All I Am, a whirring trance track built around an MGMT-style chant, was born from an impromptu jam session at Ben Lee’s Los Angeles home, with Lee and Alex Greenwald from Phantom Planet. “Ben is so kind and generous, and he really supports Australian musicians that come to America,” Wilson says. “We all microdosed mushrooms and had such a fun, silly day. The idea was I was at the computer and I was the scribe and they would all just bash on different instruments around Ben’s studio and I’d record it and try to turn it into something ... I started playing it at shows and it went off, so I messaged them in the group chat, like, ‘Can I release this?’, and they were like, ‘Oh my god, go for it’.” By I Love My Computer’s second half, technological bliss makes way for dark-web brain-rot. On Infohazard, Wilson’s back on her school bus, but now she’s being exposed to snuff films and body horror. “I was so horrified, I couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks, just beheading videos and stuff,” says Wilson, recalling the things older boys with 4chan proclivities would share on the way to school. “It was a huge loss of innocence moment. It made me think of, if I’d never had the internet, or if I’d been this age even 100 years ago, maybe I would never even know about these things?” Perhaps most impressively, I Love My Computer showcases Wilson’s range, pivoting from the Dare-style indie sleaze of London Song to the sweet PC Music-influenced propulsion of Delete. “There’s this quote from Lorde that I love so much I have it screenshotted on my desktop and I always think about it – it was in a mailing list email she wrote on the 10-year anniversary of Pure Heroine,” Wilson says. “It’s about how every person is sitting on a gold mine that no one can rob because everyone’s unique makeup gives them their own perspective. I feel like, as long as I just do what I like, I can trust that my upbringing, experiences, physiology, taste will combine in a way that makes it all feel like me.” Like every Ninajirachi release since 2018, I Love My Computer comes via NLV Records, the label imprint of Sydney DJ Nina Las Vegas. Having a female mentor to guide her through such a male-dominated industry has been a privilege, Wilson says. “You’re just so naive when you’re young, and you don’t know what you don’t know, and also I don’t come from a music family or a white-collar family, so I didn’t know anything about business industry stuff. If I hadn’t met Nina when I was so young, maybe I would have ended up in other hands who didn’t care so much.” More recently, Wilson herself has stepped in as mentor and unifier. In 2022, as part of Vivid, she launched Dark Crystal, a club night celebrating underground dance culture. Inspired by overseas parties like Subculture and Heaven (where she once saw her idol, the late electronic artist Sophie, perform), the event proved so popular that this August she’ll host its fourth annual instalment. If privately tinkering in the laptop glow is her musical foundation, performing live is its own reward. “It’s pretty hectic a lot of the time, it’s not getting to bed til four or five in the morning and then getting a flight the next day, but I love it,” Wilson says. “I’m totally sober when I’m touring; I just have heaps of fruit and vitamin C powder, and it’s really chill. So even if it’s brutal, it’s fun. It’s all just memory-making.” Ninajirachi’s I Love My Computer is out on August 8. Dark Crystal 4.0 takes place at Melbourne’s Industrique on August 22 and Sydney’s Manning Bar on August 23. Copyright © 2025"

His songs included Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, The Old Dope Peddler (set to a tune reminiscent of The Old Lamplighter), Be Prepared (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and The Vatican Rag, in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: “Get down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.”)Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colourful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics, and he was cited by Randy Newman and “Weird Al” Yankovic among others as an influence.Tom Lehrer at the height of his fame in 1966.Credit: He mocked the forms of music he didn’t like (modern folk songs, rock’n’roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.He also became well known for observing that when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Henry Kissinger in 1973, “political satire became obsolete”."

But one week before their ninth album – drumroll for the most anticipated local release of the year – that Hottest 100 Australian Songs result felt pretty good to the Hilltop Hoods.“It’s a little bit surreal to be up there with some of the songs that shaped my childhood, artists that I consider the biggest things ever,” says Dan Smith, aka Pressure, who began rhyming and recording with school friend Matt Lambert (Suffa) in the early ’90s.

Expectations are high.LoadingSo what’s it like?Older. Not as in tired – though Rage Against the Fatigue is a brilliant snapshot of socially induced insomnia – but in the emotionally literate sense. It’s the sound of three guys deep into their 40s negotiating fame, grief, gratitude, depression, family, home and the road, with their usual linguistic precision and a more refined toolkit.“I like to think it’s one of our most honest records,” says Pressure. “Hip-hop is so literal. We’ve matured in our songwriting and just as human beings as well. We’re very comfortable in our own skin. I think that’s one of the things that’s helped us connect to our listeners over the years.”"

The turtleneck has escaped its style sentence as the trusty uniform for women of a certain age who imagine that they’re Diane Keaton in a romantic comedy and computer nerds following in the white sneaker steps of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Also known as the skivvy or polo neck, the turtleneck received a get-out-of-fashion-jail-free card at the Celine runway presentation in Paris during the most recent haute couture season. Extravagant gowns encrusted with pearls or diamonds usually steal the haute couture show, but the debut of American designer Michael Rider at the French fashion house placed humble white turtlenecks front and centre.

Weekend Max Mara x Sebago loafers, $915.Credit: Bec Parsons Rider may have been inspired by former Celine designer and turtleneck devotee Phoebe Philo but his runway masterclass restored the wardrobe staple of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe to its former free-spirited glory. Here’s how to style a turtleneck and keep your cool while staying warm. The easiest way to embrace the turtleneck is to wear it with jeans or trousers as an alternative to bulky jumpers. Remember to balance out the snug fit of a thin turtleneck with straight-leg or wide pants or jeans. Marilyn Monroe wore her black turtleneck with checked capri pants and Audrey Hepburn with black tights, playing a beatnik in the classic musical Funny Face. Most of us are neither bombshells nor beatniks and more than 60 years have passed, so let’s loosen up. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Courtney Zheng “Elsje” dress, $600 (belt included).Credit: Bec Parsons One trend from the last millennium worth holding on to is feminist Gloria Steinem’s turtlenecks paired with long, statement silver necklaces from the 1970s. It’s not just groovy, it’s liberating. A turtleneck is a streamlined alternative to wearing a blouse beneath a blazer or jacket. When it comes to layering, the thinner the turtleneck the better. A white turtleneck breaking up double denim looks better than Jake Gyllenhaal breaking up fights in Road House. If you’re self-conscious about your curves, try wearing the turtleneck untucked to lengthen your silhouette. Otherwise, tuck it in and break out your best belt. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Deering “Gossamer” skirt, $280. Celine “Triomphe” sunglasses, POA.Credit: Bec Parsons If you’re after a monochrome approach, pairing a white turtleneck with a white jacket, or a black turtleneck with a black jacket, be prepared to play with textures. The cotton, wool or cashmere (if you’re fancy) of a turtleneck provides a delightful on-trend contrast with a crackly leather jacket or the sleek satin lapel of a dinner jacket. Sharon Stone’s black turtleneck worn beneath a black velvet jacket at the 1996 Academy Awards remains an inspiration to many stylists for a very good reason. The Parisian staple of a white turtleneck beneath a white collared shirt, worn with jeans and leather boots, is the height of trans-seasonal chic. Once again, make sure the turtleneck is fitted but let the shirt billow. Look for a shirt with a classic rather than tailored fit and remember, you can undo as many buttons as you like without having to worry about stiff breezes. Celine cashmere jacket, POA, silk blouse, POA, “Marco” jeans, $1700, and sneakers, $1350.Credit: Bec Parsons A black turtleneck with a white shirt and jeans also works but be careful of straying into the coastal grandma trend, exemplified by Diane Keaton, of white, on white, on white. If you take this path, be prepared for stares and stains. For the office, match your trousers with your turtleneck before layering with a white shirt. Grey and black work brilliantly, with white acting as a crisp contrast. Break out the starch because stiff cotton shirts work best with relaxed knits. Dresses with dramatic necklines, strong architectural details or summery fabrics can be given new life by wearing a turtleneck underneath. Contrasting sleeves emerging from short sleeves and fabric underneath plunging necklines can be visually exciting. It’s important to make the look intentional, letting the silhouettes speak up rather than throwing something together that looks like your laundry basket is overflowing. You don’t want to send the turtleneck back to fashion jail for another 20 years. Fashion editor: Penny McCarthy. Hair: Michael Brennan. Make-up: Chelsea Johnson. Styling assistant: Abbey Stockwell.

It depends on what you’re looking for.Credit: LululemonLeading the pack, ASICS were the official event sponsor, with most of the winners decked out in the brand (except the wheelchair marathon winners, Madison de Rozario in Under Armour and Samuel Rizzo in Nike). This, along with nudging ahead in the innovation race, has helped ASICS cement its status as a brand for competitive athletes.The brand has been playing catch up for this position since 2017, when Nike released its super light, super cushioned Vaporfly 4% (166 grams) resulting in many of ASICS’ elite athletes jumping ship to Nike as they sought the winning edge its new shoe tech offered.The new super shoes unlocked a new level of performance, with one study finding that for every 100-gram addition in shoe weight, there is a 1.11 per cent decrease in running economy. When the margins between winning and losing can be less than 1 per cent, it matters.“Winning is everything,” says ASICS Metaspeed product development project leader Shuhei Takemura.The new Metaspeed Ray: The lightest super shoe on the market.Credit: But it comes at a cost. On August 12, the Metaspeed™ Ray will become available for a cool $550 in Australia.

    "content": "Each week, Dr Kirstin Ferguson tackles questions on workplace, career and leadership in her advice column Got a Minute? This week: in trouble with the manager for acknowledging hard work, working within a rigid appraisal system and signing a new contract without being able to read it first.You shouldn’t be reprimanded for giving a team member positive feedback.Credit: Dionne GainI am a mid-level manager and my boss accused me of not being tough enough on someone in my team because I complimented them during their performance review. My staff all work really hard and none of them need to be reprimanded or given negative feedback – I consider myself lucky to work with such professionals. I’m so disgusted with his comment; he is always so negative it’s depressing, and our organisation just accepts this. What do I do? Your boss sounds like a dinosaur. High-performing teams thrive on feeling trusted, motivated and appreciated. You should never need to defend giving positive feedback where it is due. That said, you always have to make sure you balance positive feedback with areas for development when needed. Many leaders can find giving tough feedback difficult, and while I am not suggesting that is the case here, always keeping things positive can be unhelpful too.In summary, don’t let your boss’s approach cause you to change your own leadership style. If you are finding your workplace culture stuck in the last century, it may be time to find a new company where you can work alongside others who share your modern leadership approach.Our company uses a performance rating system where “meets expectations” is the default, even for people who consistently do an exceptional job. “Above expectations” is rarely given, reserved for those going far beyond their role. This leaves high performers feeling deflated and unrecognised. I praise them, but they still ask, “Why only ‘meets’?” Pay and promotion aren’t directly tied to ratings, so why not give more “above” ratings to reflect strong performance and lift morale? The system feels demotivating and out of touch. How can I better support my team or influence change?LoadingIf the performance system HR has created is demotivating your best people, there is something seriously wrong with it. In theory, I understand why these kinds of formulaic, box-ticking ideas might be helpful. In practice, however, the unintended consequences can lead to a situation where people quickly work out what is needed to game the system altogether.Perhaps you and other managers in your position might like to get together and ask for the system to be reviewed. The first question I would be asking is: why do we use this? If it isn’t tied to pay and promotions, what is the real purpose? Once HR gives you that answer (which I assume will be something around guiding areas for individual development), you can explain the impact it is having on your high performers. It seems like this is a system designed to deal with average to underperforming team members, but the real impact is on the people who are doing an impressive job. The system should be designed around retaining them, not simply managing the few who are not doing so well.I work as a disability support worker, and my employer has said we’ll soon be receiving new employment contracts. They’ve mentioned changes to the sections covering hours of duty and ordinary hours, but claim it won’t affect our roles or standing in the company. They’re also outsourcing HR and want us to sign before we’ve seen the new contracts. I feel uneasy about the lack of transparency, even though they say they’re acting in good faith. If I choose not to sign the new contract, could they be required to offer redundancy?"

    "content": "A good coffee at your favourite cafe or a peaceful, delicious dinner that you didn’t have to make yourself might not be necessities in life, but they sure can be a balm for the soul. And if you’re a parent of young kids, you need all the soul-balm you can get.But eating out when you have small children can involve a level of fortitude that can feel like more effort than it’s worth. In such situations, it’s hard not to be tempted to resort to the one tool we are told over and over again not to use: screen time.We all know what the recommendations on screen time are for kids: minimal is best, none is better, and they should definitely be avoided around meals. That’s because mealtimes are “an opportunity for communication”, says Dr Kimberley O’Brien, an educational and developmental psychologist. Plus, “if you’re distracting young people from meals, then they’re not really understanding things like nutrition, different textures, and balanced meals”.For most, dining out is not an everyday occurrence – so, surely, a little screen time is OK, right? O’Brien says it’s not a great solution for anyone, including parents.Susannah McCaughan and her friend, Ruby Davies-Nelson, with daughter Bonnie at Cafe Jack’s in Kensington, Sydney. They keep their children entertained while dining out with a range of activities, including screens. Credit: Dylan Coker“It’s a missed opportunity for socialising and for understanding social norms in a restaurant,” she warns. “Even if it’s just eye contact and smiles, that’s something that’s socially appropriate and should be encouraged in young people, rather than using screens in restaurants.”The thing is, getting kids to be civilised in public is much easier said than done – to the point that some parents avoid going out to eat with their kids.“Even if your kids are sitting quietly and doing an activity, you’re still not really able to relax or mingle, you’re always in parent mode, tending to their needs,” says Ruby Davies-Nelson, a mum to three kids aged six, three and 18 months. She says when she wants to go to a cafe or restaurant, rather than dining in, she tends to get takeaway and sit outside.“It’s much more enjoyable for me, and I don’t have to worry if the kids are noisy or up and down from their seats.”Her friend, Susannah McCaughan, a mum of two kids aged three and 18 months (with another on the way), says she and her husband are not ready to wave the white flag yet when it comes to eating out with their kids."

    "content": "On Friday afternoons, my husband and I have an “open house party” at our home. From 4pm, all our neighbours are welcome; no pressure, just an open invitation. We started the tradition after COVID-19 lockdowns, when we realised how many people our age – with young kids and no social life – were feeling isolated.It’s wonderful chaos: people are cooking dinner, there are kids asleep on the couch, and it can go on until 7pm and sometimes 2am. We’ve named our social group “Sippers” and we even have a logo for it: an illustration of a kid’s juice box next to a flagon of beer. Yes, there’s some drinking involved, but that’s not the drawcard. (I’m 15 years sober, so alcohol isn’t my incentive.)Our Friday night parties have become a place where barriers are broken down and bonds are formed, where the conversation veers between funny YouTube videos and a cancer diagnosis. The kids are there – always there – in the tapestry, either on the skate ramp in our garden, watching a movie or playing poker with the grown-ups. And it’s far from an echo chamber. The guest list is our street, so it’s not curated by backgrounds or interests.For those of us from more conservative backgrounds, throwing a party may not come as naturally.Credit: Getty ImagesDuring a debate about medical misinformation, my friend, a nurse, observed, “If I’d met you anywhere but here, I’d have so many preconceptions about you – and I’d have been wrong about all of them.”Our friendship wasn’t instant. It happened over time because we gathered, and gathered, and gathered again – with the type of social determination most of us lose after high school.For my husband, our open-door policy comes naturally; he comes from a family of “celebrators” who embrace the Aussie culture of barbecues and intergenerational beach hangs. For me, as a millennial with social anxiety raised in the closed-door culture of middle-class England, this type of “togetherness” has terrified me at times – but it’s also been a revelation.The spirit of hospitality extends beyond the party. Whether you need a babysitter or someone to lift something heavy, or there’s a real emergency, our guest list will always come running. In many ways, our open-door policy has improved my mental health more than therapy and years of meditation. It’s given me a sense of purpose and belonging and softened my self-consciousness. I used to curate the Post-It notes on my fridge before people came over. Now, I leave the reminders to “take UTI medication”. The same with our messy bathroom.Research shows that parties offering food, drink and a chance to celebrate – even small wins – are linked to longer lifespans, lower anxiety and depression, and better sleep and heart health. Yet, it’s easy to let socialising slip down – or off – our to-do list. For many of us, the party is over, and we don’t even realise what we’re missing.New data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found Americans are spending less time “socialising and communicating” than 10 years ago. For individuals, an average weekday in 2024 included just 26 minutes of “face-to-face social communication, or hosting or attending social functions”. On the weekend, that rose to 56 minutes. This was trumped by watching television and housework."

It was not until my mid-30s that the penny finally dropped.A still from the 1994 movie, Reality Bites, with Steve Zahn (Sammy), Winona Ryder (Leinana), Ethan Hawke (Troy) and Janeane Garofalo (Vickie). This may be the most inadvertently Gen X thing I’ve ever done: not bothering to learn what generation I’m a part of. That’s slack. If Gen X suffered from one malady, it was self-consciousness, with a secondary diagnosis of apathy. These are not useful traits to be holding onto in 2025, when the chaos enveloping the globe demands more than a shrug of the shoulders and contemptuously raised eyebrow.To pinpoint the moment when the rehabilitation of my jaded Gen X heart began, let’s rewind to June 2023. I’m surrounded by open browsers, but I’m not trying to prevent an unauthorised nuclear missile launch. It’s much more important than that: I’m trying to secure tickets to the Melbourne leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. The stakes are stratospheric. My oldest daughter is what you might call (if you were given to understatement) a Swiftie, but better understood as someone whose obsession warrants its own Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders entry. Her moods rise and fall based on Swift’s musical output; she confessed recently her low spirits were not the result of VCE pressures, but Swift’s extended break after her tour.Credit: Illustration: Dionne GainFloating on a sea of browsers, conscious of the maelstrom of emotions that will be unleashed should she miss out, I begin to understand that this is not just another domestic chore, like arranging dental appointments and parent-teacher interviews. To secure tickets, I must believe in the mission itself. I must buy into not only the Swift phenomena, but the unbridled enthusiasm of Gen Z. Could I become less Gen-X’y?This is no small undertaking: my Gen X snobbery is as much a part of me as the legs I walk on, and as reflexively deployed, a billowing smokestack of uppity disdain for mainstream culture that can be seen from outer space, like the Pyramids of Giza.There was no one less prepared than me to raise a Swiftie. A child who worships stadium-filling pop stars, rides the wave of each new viral trend without shame (her bedroom is currently filling with Labubu dolls), and doesn’t take sincere displays of emotion to be a measure of deep uncoolness; who doesn’t pretend not to care when really, she cares a lot. An earnest student of teen girldom, she manages her insecurities not by affecting an air of nonchalance, but by being the most fully actualised, CinemaScope version of a teenage girl she can be. Her music, her clothes and her make-up are not a studied rejection of mainstream aesthetics, as mine were, but a bear-hug of what she loves. Gen Z may carry many anxieties and burdens, but appearing unmoved by everything is not one of them.In my experience, ambivalence – about work, relationships, our very existence – was the sine qua non of Gen X. Don’t try too hard. Don’t let anyone know how much you want it – professional success, or love or money. Affect an air of affectlessness. Earnestness and sincerity were anathema. Our self-conscious ambivalence is perhaps best exemplified in a 1991 TV interview with Kim Gordon, of Sonic Youth. She has just produced a record, and the purpose of the interview is to talk about her experience of producing a record. “Is producing something you do a lot of?” the interviewer asks. “Oh yeah” replies Gordon, her voice dripping with sarcasm, eyes shaded by large black sunglasses. “I try to do it at least once a week.” She has the air of someone who’s been on the phone with Telstra all day, trying to fix a billing error. God forbid she should answer the question sincerely, or cop to enjoying what she does. This was the attitude I was marinated and cooked in."

    "content": "Cooking oil is a slippery subject. With seemingly endless varieties, ranging from dependable vegetable oil to trendy avocado oil, it’s hard to know where to turn in the oil aisle. Add to this the doubts over the health benefits of some oils when they are heated, such as extra virgin olive oil, and you may be tempted to stick to lard.In fact, the ideal choice may be one of the most common oils used for cooking in Australia. In its “virgin” form, it contains healthy organic compounds called polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants. And while these are removed to create oil for cooking, the refined version many of us use still has health benefits.With seemingly endless varieties of cooking oils, it’s hard to know where to turn in the oil aisle. But sunflower oil can have its benefits.Credit: iStockWhat is sunflower oil?Sunflower oil is an unsaturated fat that is mainly sold in two forms, refined and virgin. Both are sources of vitamins E and K. Vitamin E helps maintain the immune system, healthy skin and eyes, while vitamin K helps blood to clot properly.In addition to polyphenols, the virgin version contains lecithin, a nutrient similar to the B vitamins, and carotenoids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. The more the oil is refined, however, the more these compounds are removed. One study found that heavily refined sunflower oil lost almost all of its carotenoid content.Many of the extra nutritional benefits of virgin sunflower oil are also lost when it is heated beyond a point known as the “smoke point”. This is where the fats and compounds in the oil change and start to break down. For this reason, in order to gain the maximum nutritional punch from virgin sunflower oil, it is best used as drizzle and in dressings.All types of sunflower oil contain omega-6, a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that the body cannot make itself. It plays an important role in brain function and helps stimulate skin and hair growth, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism and maintain the reproductive system.Sunflower oil also contains low levels of omega-3, which is important for the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system (the network of hormone-producing glands)."

I loved the books as a child, and I loved the hint of the bisexual pride flag,” she says.As tattoos continue to grow in popularity, so too has the need for removal services.

Rowling have tarnished that nostalgic shine.Barlow, a Greens councillor in Sydney’s inner west, is undergoing the process of having the tattoo faded through laser removal to eventually have it covered.“As a councillor, it horrifies me that someone might see that tattoo and think I  to the same TERF [trans-exclusionary radical feminism] nonsense that she’s fighting for, and that I might stand for the same regressive political views here in Australia,” Barlow says.There was a time when it was common to warn that “tattoos are forever, so choose carefully”. But advances in laser removal technology – and greater accessibility – mean tattoos such as Barlow’s are no longer something you must live with forever.How tattoo removal worksLasers are the only way to safely remove or reduce the appearance of tattoos. High intensity pulses – in a billionth or a trillionth of a second – target and “shatter” ink particles, reducing damage to the skin and fading a tattoo over time."

    "content": "Men should not have friends. At least that’s what Friendship, the black comedy starring Paul Rudd and Tim Robinson, suggests.In the film, Craig (Robinson), is a slightly awkward suburban dad who meets his neighbour, Austin (Rudd). At first, the friendship flourishes – Austin even invites Craig to a gathering with his other male friends. But Craig becomes increasingly over-invested in the friendship, pushing further and further until the relationship completely fractures.Building new male friendships isn’t always a walk in the park. Just ask Tim Robinson (left).Credit: Fifth SeasonDirected by Andrew DeYoung, the storyline is extreme, but it still explores a question many men have likely pondered at some point: Why is it so challenging to make friends with other men?It largely depends on how they’ve been raised, says Integrated Way relationship counselling specialist Daniel Lichtman. Many, particularly those in western cultures, are taught early on to be more emotionally contained and task-oriented rather than relationship-oriented.“Many men don’t necessarily seek out a relationship for the sake of having a relationship,” he says. “When men are struggling, they’re less likely to reach out to a friend for connection because they often feel more shame and embarrassment in vulnerability than women.”Tim Robinson isn’t the only one who struggles to make new friends. It turns out it’s a growing problem among men.Instead, many opt for “going at it alone”, Lichtman says. It’s a pattern of behaviour that appears to be getting worse. In 1990, 55 per cent of men told the Survey Centre on American Life that they had at least six close friends, but in 2021, that dropped to 27 per cent. Meanwhile, one in seven men say they have no close friends. Popular Australian men’s forums suggest a similar trend locally.This isn’t for a lack of opportunity. There are ample avenues for men to make new friends, says Lichtman, such as sports clubs and men’s walking groups. Admission numbers also indicate plenty are actively taking part.However, men often still lack the deeper friendships that women frequently foster within social groups."

He might have said “human”. Anyway, I got no closer to becoming a he-man than I did to becoming emperor of China. This failure has rankled. And I blame him.Lately, gyms have emigrated from shopping centres and high streets to light industrial zones alongside car wreckers, chemical storage facilities and bikie HQs. You see muscled fellows wearing wisp singlets plodding along the backstreets like the strongest, simplest superhero in any franchise – the Hulk, the Thing – the type of erratic champion needing close and constant instruction from the mastermind of the gang lest he accidentally break North America.Credit: Robin CowcherA whiff of the underworld accompanies bodybuilding for me. Is it the thuggishness muscle implies? The fact it can be turned so readily to standover work? Or the fact bikies and crime bosses have recently got so massive? Watching a cop trying to cuff a Coffin Cheater these days is like watching a toddler attempt a Rubik’s Cube.Maybe muscle gym membership should come with an ankle tracker. One of those devices parolees wear so they can’t slip down to the pub on Tuesday arvo, slurp daytime beers and slide back into the life. You want the Gold Class membership that comes with caramel flavoured “protein shakes”? OK, put this anklet on and surrender your passport.On the street I smile at bodybuilders for the same reason I smile at pastors, nuns, Hare Krishnas and Goths – just to be nice, to affirm they have a right to belief, or cosplay, or some mix of the two. It seems mean not to, like shouting “rhubarb” in a theatre.The most frightening car crash I was ever in involved a driver from a family of famous hotheads. It was early morning, and I was a sleep-addled passenger when this fool, hollering along with one of Joe Strummer’s insurrectionist ditties, went off the road and down an embankment, rolling his Renault a couple of times. I was thrashed by a maelstrom of his bric-a-brac: mixtapes, Coke cans, cigarette lighters, footy boots, an oboe, a ping pong paddle… When the death throes of the T14 finally silenced, the driver was lying on top of me in a blizzard of Wonderbra flyers he’d been paid to box-drop but hadn’t. “These bras seem reasonably priced,” I said. “Now get off me.” We climbed up and opened the driver’s door like submariners emerging from the deep, from a mission, from a war … into a day of peace, a day we didn’t deserve.LoadingAnd this is where my prejudice against muscle hounds really took flight. We had crashed outside a gym, an outer-suburban tilt-slab bunker veneered with dark glass. On hearing the roar of the crash a dozen or so simulacrum Schwarzeneggers strode outside and began circumnavigating the wreck asking fatheaded questions and pocketing Wonderbra flyers. They were a welcome sight to us. These lads, these eager behemoths, would soon right our car. Except … they were not eager at all.It turns out extreme muscle is purely aesthetic, a type of beauty pageant, not to be mistaken as useful, not a tool that might be employed in any nine-to-five capacity. These Hercules types (as often stuck to mirrors as blowies to flypaper) are objets d’art, not beasts of burden. None will dig a hole for fear of the bulging disc and the proletarian ignominy involved. None will cart a hay bale unless applauded. None will climb a ladder, being so dangerously top-heavy."

Here are nine common symptoms to look out for.Your hands can hold clues to wider health problems.Credit: Getty Images1. Red palmsRed palms can be a harmless sign of being hot, menopausal or anxious, or the symptoms may be associated with ageing or poor circulation.“But they can also be a symptom of a skin problem like eczema or psoriasis,” says Lear.A rarer condition that causes red palms is palmar erythema, and this can be hereditary or caused by various health conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer or liver disease. It can also affect the fingertips, nail beds and sometimes the soles of the feet.Red palms may also be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis, says Laftah, and there’s a rare condition called erythromelalgia that causes burning pain, redness and hot skin on the palms."

T-shirt slogans can also help boost recognition of groups, places such as the Great Barrier Reef and issues like climate change.”“The downside is that short slogans are usually pretty vague. It does help if there is a clear message, particularly if it links to a concrete, doable action.”Marc Freeman and Camilla Freeman-Topper understand the importance of authenticity with fashionable fundraising T-shirts.

The biannual Paris couture shows never disappoint in terms of pushing the boundaries on both the fashion and beauty front. The cost of the outfits on show can reach the hundreds of thousands but, fear not, there is plenty to feast on from a beauty and hair perspective that’s easily achievable at home, especially for those willing to push the boat out a little.Hunter Schafer’s slicked-back bun highlighted her bold gilded jewellery at a recent Schiaparelli haute couture show.Credit: Getty ImagesSchiaparelli began July’s Haute Couture Week with creative director Daniel Roseberry revealing his new view for the house – heavily referencing the mid-20th century – with super-sleek hair pulled tightly back from the face and not a stray strand in sight, plus the occasional bun. It was also a popular look for front-row guests, including Joséphine Japy, Gessica Kayane and Hunter Schafer, whose slick bun showed off her gilded-flower choker.To get this look, try a good-quality hair gel such as Crown Affair’s The Finishing Gel ($73) and a good boar-bristle brush, like Drybar Flat Mate Boar Bristle Brush ($138) to tame every hair into submission.The simplicity of the hair at Schiaparelli was a perfect foil to the intensity of the make-up: black and red lips and dewy skin, created by make-up supremo Pat McGrath. To achieve the pairing of “luminous skin” with “bold, powerful lips”, McGrath says she used her own brand’s PermaGel Eye Pencil in Xtreme Black ($50) and Legendary Lip Liner in Elson ($50).At Georges Hobeika, there was a slightly devilish, goat-like twist to the hair, with locks that were parted down the middle and styled into prominent “horns” on each side. You would need an armoury of hairspray and a stylist to even attempt this creation. For a quirky-but-earthly interpretation, try high bunches, curl them back on themselves, and secure with bobby pins.LoadingMeanwhile at Chanel, models sported sleek twisted ponytails with a few stray tendrils to soften the intensity of the severely scraped-back hair; this was the perfect backdrop for the glossy glass skin that was everywhere on the runways. Complementing the hair was a bronze smoky eye – achieve a similar look at home using Chanel Ombré Premiere Laque Longwear Liquid Eyeshadow in Desert ($57).Front-row inspiration was strong at Chanel, thanks to Naomi Campbell’s teased, twisted and elevated up-do, which was a show-stopper in itself and styled by the Chanel show hairstylist, Guido Palau.Eighties inspiration is ubiquitous this season, and a standout at the Imane Ayissi show, where models wore slicked-back, retro-inspired hair paired with pastel eyeshadow lined heavily in black, and brilliant red lipstick completely flaunting all the beauty rules by playing up eyes and lips all at once. But when it comes to couture, rules are made to be broken."

The in-demand product, with velcro straps at the top of the head and nape, resembles a post-surgery mask, and has earned comparisons with Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs on social media.The latest product from Kim Kardashian’s underwear brand Skims targets the jawline.“We’ve been doing shapewear for a really long time, and now we’re going to offer amazing face shapewear, which is just such a necessity,” Kardashian said in an Instagram video. “You can see that it just snatches your chinny chin chin with the jaw, and it’s super comfortable to wear at night or just around the house.”The item is marketed on the company’s social media as “infused with collagen yarns for ultra-soft jaw support” and “a must-have addition to your nightly routine”. However, Sydney-based plastic surgeon Dr Mark Kohout suggests customers manage any expectations of waking up contoured and camera ready.“The facial shapewear is analogous to elastic waist trainers,” Kohout says. “The idea is that the elastic fabric supports your tissues and makes them less susceptible to sagging from the effects of gravity. The downside is that to have any appreciable effect, you would have to wear them around the clock for months or years.”“The garment does not change the structure of the skin, nor does it tighten the collagen or elastin fibres in your skin. This may make it of limited practicality and effectiveness.”For more lasting results, Kohout suggests researching radiofrequency, energy-based treatments."

    "content": "A rattled Carlo Tizzano was left out of the Wallabies side for the third Lions Test in Sydney “to take a deep breath”, after the controversial final ruck at the MCG left him dealing with a sore neck and a week of online abuse.Coach Joe Schmidt revealed the intense pressures endured by Tizzano - on and off the field - when explaining why he had not named the 25-year-old flanker for the third Test.The Force openside had been on the bench for the first three Tests of the year, but found himself in the middle of a controversy when he was cleaned out with a hit to his neck by Jac Morgan in the last ruck at the MCG.English podcaster James Haskell led the trolling by saying Tizzano deserved a red card for diving. Schmidt defended Tizzano by saying his instrumented mouthguard had registered a “high magnitude” impact, but confirmed he had not suffered a concussion.“He’s had a really tough week, obviously, Carlo. He’s copped a lot of online abuse,” Schmidt said.“The only thing I’d say about ... the defence of Carlo, there were just over 54Gs of force, direct force that went through the neck, along with almost 2200 rads of rotational force, which is enough to cause a serious injury.“Not to a rugby player who is as well conditioned as Carlo, but he’s probably best just left to take a deep breath.“We’re all aware of Newton’s third law [of motion] that for every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction. When that force hits him and the speed of his head collapsing down, he recoiled out the back of the ruck."

    "content": "A few days before Imane Khelif became the centre of the world’s attention, the biggest controversy at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris involved a drone. On the eve of New Zealand’s first women’s football match, Rebekah Stott spotted the craft hovering over the team’s training session.“We were just doing throw-ins, and I was waiting for Ali Riley to throw me the ball and I hear this noise,” Stott told Sam Mewis, the former American international, on her podcast The Women’s Game last year.“I’m a bit of a drone enthusiast, I’ve got one myself, and so I hear this noise, and I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh ... is that a Mavic Pro?’”Quite aside from the fact that flying drones above people was illegal in France, Stott’s discovery unravelled one of the biggest scandals in women’s football history.It turned out that the drone had been sent there by the Canadian national team, and that this was something they’d been doing for quite a while. Subsequent investigations by the Canadian media found that their junior and senior national teams, for both men and women, had been using drones as far back as 2016 to spy on opposition training sessions in a bid to gain insights on tactics and personnel.Canada’s women were docked six points, hampering their bid to defend their Olympic title, and their coach Bev Priestman, one of her assistants and an analyst were all sent home. FIFA later banned the three of them from participating in any football-related activity for a year – and ending any chance that Football Australia, who have long admired Priestman’s coaching, would approach her to become the next Matildas coach.Canada’s former head coach, Bev Priestman, is now in charge of the Wellington Phoenix’s ALW team.Credit: APSo when Wellington Phoenix appointed Priestman’s wife, Emma Humphries, a Kiwi, to head up the club’s academy, then announced that they would reveal the identity of the new head coach of their A-League Women’s team in July – which just happened to be when Priestman’s suspension was due to expire – all signs pointed to one thing.On Wednesday, three days after the ban ended, the worst-kept secret in the game was confirmed: Priestman has signed a two-year deal with the Phoenix, becoming arguably the most credentialled coach in ALW history, and also the most contentious."

Which, with their season pretty much on the line against Manly at Brookvale on Saturday, is probably still what the Tricolours need.Eight Roosters have debuted with Tedesco as their skipper this season and played enthralling, often fancy-free, up and down footy as NRL rookies often do.Tedesco has played arguably the best football of his decorated career.At 32, the Roosters No.1 has struck a rich balance between being their every man, everywhere, all the time, and putting faith and trust in his young teammates.“He’s spoken a bit about trusting our young guys and I guess our young halves to play their footy more,” hooker Connor Watson says.“That’s probably not easy for Teddy, you’re giving the reins over to someone and you don’t know how they’re going to handle it”.As Trent Robinson pointed out this week, you might as well split hairs given Tedesco has won six of the Roosters seven Jack Gibson medals awarded since he arrived in 2018."

Everyone knows we are putting player welfare, in its broadest sense, at the top of the agenda.“You can see that from what we are doing with the instrumented mouthguards, all the research, the science, the investigations. The way the laws of the game have evolved in the last few years is all about, ‘How do we have this great physical contest, but make it as safe as possible?’ That part is challenging, in terms of the player welfare statements.”"

As nations around the world grappled with the boycott, Australia’s athletes, some still only teenagers, were placed in an incredibly difficult position."

He was fourth in 2021-22 with 63 and finished in the top three the previous three seasons with 111, 76 and 77 wins.There were genuine excuses for the drop in wins last season. A fall in January at Randwick, which left Berry with a neck fracture and shoulder injury, sidelined him for five weeks. He had other stints out with a blocked nerve in his neck, a busted cheek from a fall at home and suspensions late in the season.Berry, though, is using the downturn as motivation for this season.Gringotts (left) wins a thrilling George Ryder Stakes in March, one of a number of big wins for Tommy Berry in an up and down season.Credit: Getty Images“It’s the first time in a while I haven’t been in the top three in NSW, which isn’t good enough by my standards, but to run top two or three again next season is what I’ll be aiming for,” he said.Despite the setbacks, Berry still ranked among the top-earning jockeys in 2024-25 after scoring a first group 1 in two and a half years when the Ciaron Maher-trained Gringotts won the George Ryder Stakes.

The man of the moment was a teenager just two weeks ago.But before the Bulldogs rattled up seven tries on the Sea Eagles at Allianz Stadium, they absorbed a physical assault from Matt Lodge, Jazz Tevaga and company.Minister for defence: Cameron Ciraldo.Credit: James BrickwoodIt wasn’t quite Penrith-esque, but Manly hit hard and often. And the Bulldogs responded with offloads and second-phase play, just as the few teams who troubled the Panthers during Ciraldo’s time did."

Ambitious might be an understatement.Thomas Müller and Harry Kane after one of Bayern Munich’s matches at the Club World Cup.Credit: APFirst revealed by this masthead, the Sky Blues have been in talks with the Bayern Munich legend’s management about coming to the A-League next season - and if they somehow manage to pull it off, it’d be one of the greatest coups in domestic soccer history.Even though they’ve been told they’re down to the final two - as German outlets have since reported, as well - it’s more unlikely than likely. Those in the know, plus a variety of overseas reports, say that Müller is probably bound for Major League Soccer, and the money he could earn there will trump whatever Sydney’s offer is many times over.Not to mention the post-career opportunities that the 35-year-old will be exposed to in a country that is about to co-host the World Cup, if he wants to go into the media once he hangs up his boots.But there’s still a chance.

Los Angeles FC, who have reportedly shown the strongest interest in Müller, are also attempting to sign Son Heung-min from Tottenham Hotspur. Such is their financial power, they could probably sign both. And then there’s the financial monster that is Saudi Arabia to contend with.

We have plenty more cricket coverage to fill your boots on our website so stick around and have a look, and see you next time. “We came up against a quality opposition in Australia, but as a batting group we didn’t give ourselves the best chance,” says the West Indies skipper. “We were always one step behind the eight-ball, but have to commend the bowling effort. It just didn’t happen for us today. In the Caribbean, chasing is always better due to the dew and wind factor, but that’s not something I can control.” “The wickets were better,” he says. “It was a great series for many of our guys … Inglis and Tim David, for instance. There are about five guys who can bat four … half the team are made of all-rounders and that’s the kind of squad we want to build. “I’ve had great partnerships around me, we all lean on each other. A massive series win; the T20 World Cup isn’t too far away so a bit of consistency will be good.” “It was a slower wicket, so I tried to hit the wicket hard and bowl some slower ones,” says Dwarshius, who took the key wickets of King, Hope and Hetmyer. “A lot of thinking and planning goes into the games, to not let batters access certain areas. It was a challenge on these batter-friendly wickets ... felt like a nice, tidy challenge. It’s amazing to be part of this historic squad. I’ll look back at this series for the rest of my life.” Abbott wastes no time, getting in the zone with a couple of deliveries from Forde before using the last ball of the 17th over to drive him to mid-on for a boundary that brings the run tally to 173. Hardie breaks the streak of singles with a reverse sweep that hits the ropes and gets Australia four runs closer, and they continue to pepper singles until … Dwarshuis tries to get it done in one hit but doesn’t go the distances and is caught. Australia 7-166, need five runs from 24 balls There are five overs remaining from which to do it and the visitors have four wickets in hand. After a pretty significant wobble, this appears to be in the bag. The run rate has slowed but Hardie and Dwarshuis are chipping away at singles. Australia 6-158, need 13 runs from 30 balls He made 32 off 18 balls before, in the 12th over, Hosein adds a second scalp to his tally for the innings. Forde makes the catch between his legs of all places after a bit of a slip and juggle, and Australia are down to their lower order. Dwarshuis joins Hardie at the crease. Bit of a test given the likes of Abbott, Ellis and Zampa haven’t had much of a chance to bat thanks to the fine work of those above them. We’ll see. Australia 6-149 after 13 overs And how it has given England a glimpse of what awaits in Australia this Ashes series, writes the London Telegraph’s Nick Hoult in this piece: What England did on Sunday night was lame, but the theory that Indian teams play for personal milestones is one shared by Australia. In fact, England’s reaction was very Australian. Matthew Hayden once picked up on the “milestone culture” in Indian cricket. “We don’t really play for stats. We play for wins. That’s the Aussie way,” said Steve Waugh, but it could just as easily have been Stokes. England’s mistake was making it look petty rather than pointed. 1 of 4 Copyright © 2025"

Brookfield pulled out of the bidding war in March, while Bain dropped out in May, citing volatility on global markets.CC Capital, a New York-based private equity firm, is buying Insignia with an alternative asset manager called OneIM. The deal will be CC Capital’s first investment in Australia, and it is subject to approvals from Insignia shareholders and authorities including the Foreign Investment Review Board and the prudential regulator.LoadingInsignia is the fifth-biggest player in the super sector, where it owns MLC and various other brands, and this is a key attraction for the buyer.

There is no doubt that its appeal to India, and visitors and immigrants from India and South-East Asia is incredibly appealing for us. We want to win that business and target that particular market. But first and foremost it’s anchored around the fact it’s Australia’s game, it’s a community game and we’re Australia’s oldest bank,” he said.Miller has a keen interest in sport – two of his siblings have competed at the Olympics and his daughter Desiree is a winger for Australia’s women’s rugby team the Wallaroos.The Sydney-based bank, which already sponsors the NRL, also hopes the deal can help raise awareness of its brand in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, where AFL is the dominant football code."

The fact that it wasn’t up probably is another data point that reinforces it is open to the Reserve Bank to cut rates,” Miller said at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle event in Sydney.LoadingAt the same time, Miller still cautioned that the progress in dealing with inflationary challenges was “not overwhelming”, and he pointed out markets had been convinced there was a cut coming in July, only for the Reserve Bank to hold. He said the central bank remained focused on whether this was the right time to cut rates.“It feels like there’s even more evidence now that they should [cut rates], but I can’t help but think that only four weeks ago, everyone was absolutely clear that there was a rate cut coming, and it didn’t,” he said.“I think we’re lucky to have a Reserve Bank and a governor with that independence and that confidence to look after the country’s long-term interests.”"

    "content": "Of all the things that could affect Commonwealth Bank’s lofty share price, the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam in China is probably not top of mind.But when bank-watchers scour the world for explanations on why bank shares lagged last month, an enormous hydroelectric dam project in Tibet is one of several factors that do come up.The reason, according to analysts, is that big ASX investors are constantly tossing up whether to put their money into either of the market’s two massive sectors: banks or miners. Which way investors lean between these two sectors can have a big bearing on share prices: if investors prefer miners, the banks tend to lag, and vice versa.In market jargon, it’s referred to as “rotating” between the two sectors, and it can have a significant impact on share prices, especially for the most highly valued bank, CBA.It means the price of bank shares can be influenced by things that have little direct bearing on bank’s core business, but that matter a lot for miners, such as the strength of China’s construction sector, which affects commodity prices.A section of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, where China this month started building what’s intended to be the world’s largest hydroelectric dam.Credit: Getty ImagesSome argue that is what has happened in the past month or so, and the launch of an enormous dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet fed into that optimism on commodities.The underperformance of banks was a key trend in July. Except for ANZ Bank, the other Big Four lagged the ASX 200 index. CBA lost about 4 per cent in the month. Miners had the opposite experience: BHP gained close to 7 per cent in the month.This was a stark change from the dominant narrative of the past year, in which banks have sharply outperformed miners, much to the frustration of the investment pros who can’t fathom why the CBA share price has kept rising.Now, the CBA share price is more than 8 per cent below its record highs of June and the bank’s market value has slipped under the $300 billion milestone, though CBA shares are still up strongly since the start of the year."

    "content": "The corporate watchdog is urging the Commonwealth Bank to rethink its position on refunding fees paid by low-income customers, after the bank declined to pay further refunds following a regulatory probe into excessive fees.In ramping up pressure on the country’s biggest bank, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission invoked the “pub test” often used in political debate, and warned it could consider taking court action.On Tuesday ASIC said banks would refund $60 million to low-income customers receiving government concession payments who were in high-fee bank accounts despite being eligible for cheaper products.ASIC chair Joe Longo (left) and commissioner Alan Kirkland urged CBA to rethink its stance on fee refunds.ANZ Bank will pay an estimated $47.9 million in the latest round of refunds, followed by Westpac, which committed to paying back more than $9.9 million. National Australia Bank was not included in ASIC’s review because it has not charged dishonour, account-keeping or overdraw fees on transaction accounts since 2014.Unlike Westpac and ANZ, CBA has declined to pay refunds over this issue, arguing the fees in question were disclosed to customers and charged in accordance with their terms and conditions. The bank, which has the most household customers of the big four, said its customers on government concession payments were a diverse group of people with varying levels of income, savings and property ownership.LoadingIn response, ASIC stepped up pressure on the bank on Tuesday. The regulator’s chair, Joe Longo, told the banking giant not to take a legalistic approach and warned that the watchdog could look at a more “court-based” approach if there was no improvement.“If ASIC is compelled to revisit a court-based approach to solving that problem, then that’s a matter for the commission and we will look at that in time to come,” he said at a press conference in Sydney.“But the real point for this morning’s purposes is that, is it really a good use of public resources to expect the regulator to go after a major bank on this kind of topic when every other major bank is doing the right thing?”"

    "content": "Banks will refund $60 million to low-income customers receiving government concession payments who were in high-fee bank accounts despite being eligible for cheaper products after a probe by the corporate watchdog.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) will on Tuesday announce that about 770,000 customers will receive refunds from banks in the latest development in the regulator’s push for banks to pay back various account fees charged to people receiving government concession payments.ANZ Bank is paying out the most in the latest round of refunds, followed by Westpac, while Commonwealth Bank is not paying further refunds after it previously made $25 million in “goodwill payments” to about 87,000 Indigenous concession customer accounts.National Australia Bank was not included in ASIC’s review because it has not charged dishonour, account-keeping or overdraw fees on transaction accounts since 2014, the regulator said.The corporate cop says banks will pay $60 million in refunds to customers eligible for lower-cost accounts.Credit: Louie DouvisASIC last year said Commonwealth Bank, ANZ Bank, Westpac and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank would refund $28 million to people on low incomes, particularly First Nations customers, after a review found the customers had been kept in high-cost products even though they were eligible for lower-cost accounts.Since that report, the estimated $28 million in refunds has swelled to $33 million, and ASIC has widened its work with banks to look at the effect on all low-income customers from charges including dishonour, overdraw and account-keeping fees.As a result, a further $60 million will be refunded to more than 770,000 customers, as three of the four banks named in last year’s report have committed to paying refunds to a broader group of customers.A further seven banks have also committed to paying refunds, the watchdog said.It brings the total payout to customers receiving government concession payments, whom ASIC said were typically known as “low-income customers”, to $93 million."

So it was hard for me and for my family,” Irvine said to outgoing ABA chief executive Anna Bligh, who is a former premier of Queensland.“I expect that there’s public scrutiny in roles like this, you just hope that it’s even-handed and balanced as you kind of go through it. I’m sure you’ve experienced this as a politician in the past and many public figures will experience media,” he said. “I’ve just got to get through it.Loading“I love the job that I do. It’s a real privilege to run the National Australia Bank. There’s a real noble purpose in what we do – helping people navigate their financial lives – and that gives me energy.”The Australian Financial Review reported last week that major investors had raised concerns about Irvine’s management style and drinking at customer meetings and events with the bank’s directors.The report said the issues about his management approach were raised with NAB chairman Phil Chronican at an investor lunch in Sydney last month, citing unnamed sources."

    "content": "The family that ran India’s largest luggage maker for more than half a century is packing it in, with control of Mumbai-based VIP Industries passing to private equity.“What do I do?” chairman Dilip Piramal, 75, wondered aloud in a TV interview after announcing the sale. “The younger generation is not interested in management.”Piramal isn’t the only ageing businessperson to have run out of successors. “Today among the scions of some of the most affluent families of India, someone is an artist, someone wants to be a sportsman, someone wants to run a small restaurant. There’s nothing wrong in that. It’s the modern trend, people want to do their own things,” he said.Ananya Birla, 31, has her own interests that are independent of the sprawling commodities behemoth led by her father.Credit: Getty Images for Kaushik VelendraTwo hundred years ago, that “modern” trend among young people used to be enterprise. That’s when families like Piramal’s began to spread out of the Marwar region in land-locked northern India to take advantage of British-controlled trading opportunities in the port cities of Bombay and Calcutta – now Mumbai and Kolkata. Cotton, jute and opium sold to China provided the seed capital to the Marwari business community for everything from textile mills to cement factories.Radhika Piramal, a Harvard University MBA, was the chief executive officer of luggage giant VIP industries for a few years before quitting in 2017By the early 20th century, these emerging industrial empires were large enough to challenge the colonial masters and their commercial interests. The likes of Ghanshyam Das Birla openly supported Mahatma Gandhi’s campaign for independence, even as they outran rivals like Andrew Yule & Co. The Birla House in Delhi, a prominent hub for the freedom movement, was also where Gandhi was assassinated. As the sway of family firms continued after India’s 1947 independence, it was believed that newer generations would always be available to take over the reins.Below the surface, however, the link between ownership and management has been weakening for some time. Piramal’s daughter, Radhika, a Harvard University MBA, was the chief executive officer for a few years before quitting in 2017 and relocating with her spouse to London. Her same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in India. The luggage maker was back to being in the care of professional managers, a double-edged sword considering that a rival firm set up by a former managing director is now three-fifths bigger than VIP by market value.The heirs of prominent business families – Millennial and Gen Z billionaires – are setting their own life goals. It’s the sensible thing to do. In a labour-surplus economy, access to capital through clan networks and strategic marital alliances was family-run firms’ core advantage. But via public markets and private equity, finance is now available to a much wider section of entrepreneurs. Risk-taking has been democratised.That frees up younger members of business dynasties to try new things. Someone recently asked the singer-songwriter Ananya Birla on social media if she was from the family behind India’s largest-selling cement brand. She is indeed the great-great-granddaughter of Ghanshyam Das Birla. But from financial inclusion among rural women to a recently launched beauty brand, the 31-year-old Oxford graduate has her own interests that are independent of the sprawling commodities behemoth led by her father."

Irvine said he was invited but didn’t attend the meeting, which was held in the middle of the night, his time, given he was holidaying overseas."

But investors have been more interested in Macquarie’s executive pay and its record on compliance, which has been in the spotlight after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) launched legal action against the bank in May, alleging “repeated and systemic” misleading conduct over a failure to report short sales.LoadingIt was the watchdog’s fourth regulatory action against Macquarie in just over a year. Earlier in May, ASIC slapped additional licence conditions on Macquarie Bank, citing several compliance failures relating to futures dealing and over-the-counter derivatives.Stevens said on Thursday that the ASIC matter on short selling was before the courts so he was limited in what he could say, but that any remuneration effects from the case would be reflected in the coming financial year. He also vowed to take on the concerns of shareholders regarding pay. “The board hears your message and will reflect carefully on addressing those concerns,” he said."

Jennifer Lopez shocked fans when she hit the stage in dangerously high-cut bodysuits during her WorldPride performance in Washington, DC on Saturday. Created by New York-based brand The Blonds, the sparkly silver thong-style nearly caused a wardrobe malfunction during a rendition of her new song, Save Me Tonight. Lopez’s look also included a plunging neckline and grommets studding the barely there piece. Lopez, who works with stylists Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn, rocked the bodysuit with coordinating shimmery silver over-the-knee boots. The On The Floor singer, 55, smouldered in her signature bombshell make-up look, finishing her glam with long waves of honey-blonde hair.

And the sultry looks didn’t stop there — Lopez bared her toned body in a sparkly bra and matching tiny bottoms with a flame design. “Major shoutout to @theblondsny for slaying my sparkly World Pride stage looks — and to @fashionbyreyortiz for that fierce black catsuit moment,” Lopez wrote in an Instagram caption. “You all didn’t just understand the assignment, you rewrote it.

What a show you gave us my love!! The queen is back and a third wrote, “Add runway model to your resume baby!!! Tens across the board.” Per Out Magazine, Lopez stopped to thank her queer fans amid her performance. “Over the years, your love and your support have been a source of strength for me and today I am here to celebrate you,” she said to the crowd. “I’m so happy to be able to be here to celebrate community, diversity, love, and freedom.” This story originally appeared on Page Six and is republished here with permission.

    "content": "Justin Timberlake has released a lengthy public statement detailing his secret battle with a “debilitating” illness. Justin Timberlake has been diagnosed with “debilitating” Lyme disease. The singer made the health admission in a lengthy Instagram statement today while reflecting on his Forget Tomorrow tour, which wrapped in Turkey this week. “I’ve been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease -— which I don’t say so you feel bad for me –– but to shed some light on what I’ve been up against behind the scenes,” the 44-year-old told his followers. Timberlake noted that Lyme disease, which is a bacterial infection spread by ticks, “can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically.” MORE: Justin Timberlake surprise money move Being diagnosed helped the “shocked” Grammy winner understand “why [he] would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.” He continued, “I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out.” The former *NSYNC member ultimately decided, “The joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling.” He is “so glad [he] kept going” to prove his “mental tenacity” and share “special moments” with fans. Timberlake acknowledged elsewhere in his caption that he chose to be “transparent about [his] struggles” so they would not be “misinterpreted.” The singer, notably, has been blasted for lacklustre performances since kicking off his tour in April 2024. In one viral video shared via TikTok last week, Timberlake strolled around the stage and engaged in occasional dance moves, rarely bringing the microphone to his mouth. “Go on girl, give us nothing,” one social media user wrote of the compilation. One fan complained, “I get that you have a lot of concerts and are touring the world, or whatever, but you cannot be singing less than a quarter of a song.” Additionally, Timberlake made headlines earlier this month when he was caught on camera screaming at crew members over an issue-riddled performance in England. The songwriter’s wife, Jessica Biel, showed her support for her partner by reposting his health news to her own Story.

    "content": "The fallout in the Coldplay affair scandal continues, with the female HR chief at the centre of the storm making a huge decision. The woman at the centre of the Coldplay kiss cam scandal has resigned. Kristin Cabot, who was caught on the jumbotron canoodling with her boss Andy Byron at the UK band’s Boston concert last Wednesday, has stepped down as the HR chief at Astronomer, a job she held for less than a year. The New York-based tech company confirmed the news in a statement on Thursday, US time. “I can confirm that Kristin Cabot is no longer with Astronomer, she has resigned,” a spokesperson for the company told Page Six. It comes days after Byron also resigned from his job as the firm’s CEO. “As stated previously, Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” a rep for the tech company said on Saturday. “Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.” After the pair infamously scrambled to hide from the concert kiss cam, and subsequently made headlines around the world, Astronomer announced it was launching a formal investigation into the scandal and placed Cabot and Byron on leave. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin was left bewildered by their actions on the big screen, joking onstage the pair were either “really shy or having an affair”, as details swiftly emerged about their respective marriages. Byron, who is estimated to have a net worth of $A76 million, is married to a woman named Megan Kerrigan Byron, who has since removed his last name from her Facebook and deactivated her social media accounts. She is yet to comment publicly. Cabot, for her part, appears to be married to Privateer Rum’s CEO Andrew Cabot, since they share the same last name and are co-owners of the same house in New Hampshire. She divorced her first husband, Kenneth Thornby, in 2022, according to Massachusetts court records. Neither Byron nor Cabot have commented on the affair allegations. Meanwhile, the fate of both their respective marriages remains unknown. Cabot was hired as the company’s human resources officer in November 2024, while Byron held the position of CEO from July 2023. He’s a social media sensation with more than 200 million views online, and now, the Tree of Wisdom has made a mega announcement.

    "content": "Police are investigating two UK bands following their controversial “free, free Palestine” chants at the Glastonbury Festival. Police have put UK bands Bob Vylan and Kneecap on notice following their controversial performances at the Glastonbury festival on Saturday. Avon and Somerset Police are examining video footage from the famed music festival to determine if criminal offences were committed when bands Bob Vylan and Kneecap took to the stage. The investigation was sparked after British punk duo Bob Vylan led festival-goers in chanting “free, free Palestine” and “death, death to the IDF” – referencing the Israel Defense Forces – to the packed-out crowd, many of whom were waving Palestinian flags. Irish rap trio Kneecap took to the West Holts Stage after Bob Vylan and followed suit, encouraging concertgoers to chant “free Palestine” during their set. While onstage, band member Naoise O Caireallain, who performs as Moglai Bap, also slammed UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as their fans waved banners and wore face paint to support the band. “The Prime Minister of your country, not mine, said he didn’t want us to play, so f**k Keir Starmer,” he told the crowd. The performance came just one after before JJ O Dochartaigh, aka DJ Próvaí, was seen wearing an anti-Israel campaign group ‘Palestine Action’ T-shirt in a social media post. The stage incidents have since prompted police to review video evidence from both performances to assess whether to proceed with criminal investigations. “We are aware of the comments made by acts on the West Holts Stage at Glastonbury Festival this afternoon,” Avon and Somerset Police tweeted on X. “Video evidence will be assessed by officers to determine whether any offences may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.” The performances have also drawn criticism from the UK government, with a spokesperson saying in a statement, “We strongly condemn the threatening comments made by Bob Vylan at Glastonbury.” Social media has also exploded with outrage over the bands’ controversial appearances, with US rapper Azealia Banks among the voices condemning the performances. “That is actually crazy. To allow an artist to incite a mob and shout death upon anyone at a major music festival is CRAZZZZYYYY,” she tweeted on X. “And like how does he think that’s going to accomplish anything? Wooooow the UK is losing its mind.” “There’s nothing worse than artists who lose their sense of subjectivity. The art of ‘doing everything to express what I feel’ should be a matter for therapy, not for performance,” another echoed. “Way to turn a music festival into hate festival. So sad and crazy,” another commented. While some X users argued that the bands were simply exercising their “freedom of speech”, their comments were mostly drowned out. “This is NOT free speech. This IS HATE SPEECH! Absolutely disgusting that this allowed,” one tweeted, with another noting, “I remember when music festivals were about coming together around music and unity with fellow humans. I guess this one is a Nazi death rally … glad I’m too old for this.” But fans of Kneecap were not fazed by the controversy. Gemma Gibson, 41, from Newcastle, told the Irish Times before their set she was “really excited” to see Kneecap perform, dismissing calls for the performance to be cancelled. “Well, that would be completely against everything that Glastonbury stands for,” she said. “This is where they should be.” Greg Robertson, 30, told the newspaper, “I don’t think politicians should really have too much of an impact on a weekend where everyone’s trying to have fun and trying to maybe create a more optimistic future.” To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Pop star Jessica Mauboy is going it alone, as she drops a new single to soundtrack one of Australian TV's most emotional farewells. Jessica Mauboy has entered her Boss Era. After almost 20 years in the major record label system in Australia, Mauboy has severed ties with Warner Music to launch her emotional new single While I Got Time on her independent imprint Jamally. Mauboy and her co-writer PJ Harding were given a cryptic brief to write the powerful ballad, unaware it was intended to soundtrack the heart-wrenching departure of Lynne McGranger’s beloved character Irene from Home and Away. Seven has yet to confirm when McGranger’s final episode will air this month. The wildly popular actress, who is the favourite to take home the Gold Logie on Sunday, came up with the storyline of her character exiting the show after 33 years due to an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. She wanted to foster a national conversation about the disease and care of elderly patients. “There was no communication whatsoever that we were writing a song for Irene,” Mauboy said. “They asked us to write a song about crossing oceans, travelling, moving away and leaving family and having all these memories of the people that you love. “As travellers, as writers, as collaborators, we’ve experienced those times of sacrificing being away and missing home.” Mauboy and Sydney songwriter and producer Harding, who has penned Grammy nominated songs with Noah Cyrus, completed a rough demo in half a day. It was immediately sent to the Home and Away producers who called McGranger in to hear it. She was moved to tears. “The producers told me they wanted to talk to me and I was like ‘Well, you can’t fire me, I’ve left!’” McGranger said. “They played me the song and the footage (of her final scenes) and it is so powerful and moving. “I filmed the bloody thing, and I watch it with the song and I’m crying.” It’s been a year of big changes in Mauboy’s life, both personally and professionally. She welcomed her first child, daughter Mia, with husband Themeli Magripilis in January. After three years in development, in March the pop star and award-winning actress launched a sun-care brand Desert Rose, inspired by her childhood in the Northern Territory outback under Australia’s harsh sun. And now she has launched Jamally, her indie record label. Sony exercised their option to sign the 16-year-old singer from Darwin when she was runner-up on the fourth season of Australian Idol in 2006. She parted ways with the major label in 2020 after frustrations with the executives’ creative vision for her next album and signed with rival Warner Music. Mauboy released her fifth record, the top 10 hit Yours Forever last February. But she reached another impasse over her artistic future and decided to go independent. “I’ve dedicated my whole life for the last 15 years or more to music and the label and their process and I wasn’t really doing what I deeply wanted, or the permission to do it,” she said. “The decision came to go out on my own and yes, there’s gonna be a lot more things to do, but I’m willing to take that risk (instead of) spending time doing the same thing over and over again.” Wanting to start a family and spend more time with her and her husband’s clans also galvanised her decision to take full control over her career. “I’ve always wanted to be a mum. I come from a big family so I’ve wanted that for myself, I wanted that for my family and to reconnect after that time away, the time I’d sacrificed of not even being with them, or dipping in and dipping out. “I want to be there fully, mentally, physically, and loving everything that I am actually doing and making a decision on. I’m making the choices and I’m actually doing it my way. For the first time.” Mauboy will give ‘While I Got Time’ its live premiere at the National Indigenous Music Awards in Darwin on August 9, where she will also be inducted to the NIMAs Hall of Fame, alongside revered First Nations artists including Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, Ruby Hunter, Kev Carmody and Gurrumul. She said she was deeply humbled for the honour from her community. “I did think about how do I as an artist who’s still making music, still trying to discover where my place is, receive such recognition, so high in the music industry, when you look at the other Hall of Famers, the giants,” she said. “Have I done enough? To get into the Hall of Fame, you are meant to have done everything. “I am deeply humbled and I keep thinking about how I’ve always gone into music doing it for community. The NIMAs was the birth of who I am as an artist. “This is going to make me work even more harder. I’m not finished, I want to go to the ends of the earth with music.” While I Got Time is out now.

    "content": "UK singer Matty Healy appeared to make a dig at his high-profile ex Taylor Swift during his set at the Glastonbury festival. Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend Matty Healy appeared to drag the pop star while performing at the Glastonbury Festival in England. The 1975 frontman took a moment to address the crowd at Worthy Farm in Somerset on Friday night, saying, “What this moment is making me realise is that I probably am the best,” per a video posted on Variety’s X account. “I’m probably the best songwriter of my generation,” he continued while raising a glass of beer. “The best, what do we say — a poet — ladies and gentlemen, is what I am.” Healy, 36, indirectly appeared to be talking about Swift’s 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is believed to contain several brutal nods to the rocker. The star further bragged that he was a “generational wordsmith.” A fan in the background of the clip joked that Healy was hinting at the pop superstar’s album. Healy and Swift, 35, dated briefly for a month from May to June 2023, following the latter’s split from Joe Alwyn. During their short-lived romance, the duo were inseparable, with the crooner attending several of the Grammy winner’s sold-out Eras Tour concerts. They were also often spotted in New York City, including at the Electric Lady recording studio. Page Six also learned that Swift and Healy were caught packing on the PDA at Casa Cipriani while out with Jack Antonoff and Margaret Qualley. When the duo split, an insider told Entertainment Tonight that it was due to incompatibility and scheduling issues. When Swift released TTPD in April 2024, fans were surprised to discover much of the searing album was about her relationship with Healy as opposed to Alwyn, the latter of whom she was with for six years. It was rumoured that she wrote the album’s title track, Guilty As Sin, Down Bad, Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus, The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived and I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can) about Healy. A source told Us Weekly that Healy was “blindsided” by the album. Swift moved on with boyfriend Travis Kelce over the summer of 2024, and they’ve been going strong ever since. Healy, meanwhile, got engaged to model Gabbriette Bechtel in June 2024.

Newly discovered video shows a fresh angle to Astronomer CEO Andy Bryon wrapping his arms around his HR chief, Kristin Cabot, at the Coldplay show where their cheating was caught on the kiss-cam. A fan shared the footage of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin singing up close — with the disgraced former CEO cuddling Cabot on a balcony behind him, reports the New York Post. “POV: Trying to get the best photo of Coldplay but you end up getting this viral affair as well,” the caption read, with the pair seen swinging to the music together in the first row of the mezzanine. Byron and Cabot — who are both married to other people — were caught copying up at the concert when they were unexpectedly caught on the kiss-cam in a notoriously viral video. The pair, while initially smiling, started to panic under the spotlight, with Cabot quickly covering her face and Byron ducking out of view, the viral video shows. Coldpay’s Martin, seeming a bit confused by the awkward situation, joked, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” The video immediately took the internet by storm, and the couple faced swift repercussions. Andy was forced to resign from Astronomer over the scandal, and Cabot has been placed on leave. This article originally appeared in the New York Post and was reproduced with permission.

    "content": "He’s a social media sensation with more than 200 million views online, and now, the Tree of Wisdom has made a mega announcement. Yes, the Tree of Wisdom did catch The Wiggles cast off-guard when he pulled out those dance moves during filming. Dominic Field, as he’s known out of his vibrant green leafy costume, has exploded in popularity over the past year thanks to his signature set of chaotic routines on the Australian children’s program, which have made him a bona fide social media sensation with more than 200 million views. And just months after finding viral fame, Field is slated to headline his own national tour, with The Wiggles today announcing the upcoming ‘Tree of Wisdom Arena Spectacular Tour’ kicking off in November, as well as his own studio album to be released in October. Field’s public favour all stems back to The Wiggles’ recent reimagining of the catchy Irish folk song Rattlin’ Bog. In the music video, he breaks out into a series of chaotic dance moves that progressively get more and more adventurous. Among the hundreds of re-shares on TikTok, including from US reality star Khloe Kardashian, the general consensus has been: “I want whatever the Tree of Wisdom is having.” Aside from that, many viewers have also been eager to understand what went down on-set when it was filmed, with a flurry of comments pointing to a visibly mystified Purple Wiggle Lachy, who attempts to hold character as Field lets loose. Speaking to news.com.au, Field confirmed no-one knew just how hard he was going to go. “The way we work at The Wiggles … it wasn’t on the schedule four months in advance. You know? It was very much just like, we’ve got a week of filming and we’ll see what we can fit in,” Field says. “And so it was very much just, ‘OK next we’re doing the Rattlin’ Bog.’ It’s such difficult song to sing. There’s so many words. So it was a matter of, they’re [the core cast] locked into to what they need to do, and I’ve pretty much got free range, and my ultimate goal was to try to slip up Lachy, or slip up someone in the background. “Every time I’m dancing, I’m trying to catch someone off guard. I’m also thinking, ‘OK, what can I do next?’ And whatever comes out when it comes out. That’s what happens, and it always seems to get bigger and faster.” Fans can expect that signature energy for Field’s upcoming tour, with the set list comprising of Wiggles classics and music from the upcoming Tree of Wisdom album. Two tracks have been unveiled early today, including Field’s cover of Tina Turner’s iconic Nutbush City Limits featuring Yellow Wiggle Tsehay Hawkins. Field has a grand goal with the iconic dancefloor earworm, revealing The Wiggles have discovered the song is only a staple in Australia, despite Turner’s US roots. “We’ve realised recently that Australia is the only one who does the dance,” Field says. “We’ve been touring the world and we play this song and we just get these looks. Even in New Zealand, our close neighbours. It’s not much of a thing there. “No one knows the nutbush dance. So we’ve taken it on ourselves. We are going to be the international teachers of the nutbush dance.” Field, the youngest child of former Wiggles manager Paul Field and nephew of OG Blue Wiggle Anthony Field, who first appeared in the beloved group as a one-year-old in 1995, has also managed to transcend the target youth market, assembling a fanbase of what he coins “tree-nagers” and parents alike. Just weeks ago, Field set the Old Mates pub in New York alight when he whipped out his signature moves for dozens of adults, yet again, going viral on the platform. He’s chuffed by the admiration, mostly because he’s quietly been “that guy” on wedding dance floors for years. “I think it just really reminds everyone of that one guy at a wedding, or that one guy on the dance floor, who doesn’t really care what’s going on around him,” Field says. “I think the thing I’m proudest of the most is … What you see of the Tree is very much who I am. I am that guy at the wedding who’s just having the best time. “I’m the youngest of five children. So I’ve always been trying to get the attention of my parents and all that stuff. So it’s just me just having the most fun. And I think that resonates with people.” Presale tickets for ‘The Wiggles’ Tree of Wisdom Big Show Arena Spectacular Tour’,  by the Australian Fruit and Vegetable Industry, will be available from 1pm AEDT Tuesday July 29 for Amex Card members. General public tickets go on sale this Friday August 1 at 2pm. “It’s going to be in the round, which we haven’t done for quite some time. The original Wiggles did it way back in the day, but this new generation of Wiggles, we’re doing it in the round, in the arena. It’s gonna be spectacular,” Field says. “Of course, we’ll have the classic songs that everyone knows and loves from The Wiggles, but we’re throwing in some new stuff. There’s gonna be balls flying around, and of course, there’s gonna be some new stuff from the Tree of Wisdom album as well. It’s going to get people dancing and it’s going to bring that energy up.” THE WIGGLES’ TREE OF WISDOM ARENA TOUR DATES RAC Arena, Perth – Saturday, November 1 Thebarton Theatre, Adelaide – Sunday, November 9 Hobart Entertainment Centre, Hobart – Saturday, November 15 AIS Arena, Canberra – Saturday, November 22 John Cain Arena, Melbourne – Saturday, November 29 Brisbane Entertainment Centre, Brisbane – Saturday, December 6 Newcastle Entertainment Centre, Newcastle – Wednesday, December 10 Qudos Bank Arena, Sydney – Saturday, December 13 ICC, Sydney – Saturday, December 20 TRECC, Tamworth at Toyota 54th Tamworth Country Music Festival 2026 – Sunday, January 25, 2026 Liam and Noel Gallagher paid tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne on their first sold-out night at Wembley, and fans went absolutely wild.

    "content": "Liam and Noel Gallagher paid tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne on their first sold-out night at Wembley, and fans went absolutely wild. Oasis fans who turned out for the iconic band’s concerts in Wembley were definitely not disappointed, as this incredible footage shows. The band, led by Noel and Liam Gallagher, have been back on tour since July 4 – reuniting after a bust up broke up the band 16 years ago. They are currently performing in London as part of seven sold-out shows at the iconic Wembley Stadium, The Sun reports. A new video posted to Instagram shot from the stage behind the famous band and looking out to the crowd, showed thousands of people jumping up and down as the band kicked off one of their most popular songs. The stadium moved as one as Noel played guitar and frontman Liam urged the crowd on by waving his arms up in the air. The video was shared to the official Oasis Instagram account where fans flooded it with positive comments. “Everytime we see these clips it’s so refreshing to see the crowd enjoying themselves, and not watching through their screens,” wrote one person. Another added: “A sea of Oasis fans in 2025 what a time to be alive … Thank you guys this tour has been better than I have imagined it would be.” A third commented: “Best night with the best band!” And a fourth posted: “Wow! Regardless of whether you are a fan of band or not, this is amazing.” Oasis played its first shows at Wembley in 16 years and in the first concert on Friday paid tribute to Black Sabbath frontman, Ozzy Osbourne, who died on Tuesday aged 76. As the band played its 1994 Top Ten hit, Live Forever, a giant image of Ozzy appeared on the screens in the stadium. The brothers also sang the track Rock ’N’ Roll Star, from the same year, in honour of Ozzy, who was the self-proclaimed Prince of Darkness. Liam told the 81,000-strong crowd: “I want to dedicate this one to Ozzy Osbourne — a rock ’n’ roll star.” Earlier in the week, Oasis sent fans wild by releasing a live track from the reunion tour. The live rendition of one of Oasis’ most famous songs, Cigarettes and Alcohol, was released after the band also dropped Slide Away, which was recorded and released from their first date in Cardiff. Oasis will perform five more concerts at Wembley on July 30 and August 2 and 3. They will return towards the end of their tour for two more dates on September 27th and 28th.

    "content": "After his shock Triple J debut, Jimmy Barnes is marking Working Class Man's 40th birthday with an all-star line-up of 80s legends. Jimmy Barnes didn’t have Working Class Man landing on Triple J’s Hottest 100 on his list of ways to celebrate this year’s 40th anniversary of his signature anthem. “It’s really nice to actually get airplay on Triple J; it’s the first time in 40 years,” Barnes said laughing. Australia’s favourite rock star will see out the year with the Working Class Man 40th Anniversary Tour as the song clearly finds a younger audience, generating more than 70 million streams in recent years. With Australian music fans tripping on 80s rock and pop nostalgia, Barnes has enlisted Icehouse, his Cold Chisel bandmate Ian Moss and Kate Ceberano for the mini-festival shows later this year. The tour kicks off at Mount Duneed Estate in Geelong on November 22 and then heads to Sirromet Wines in Mount Cotton November 29, Bimbadgen, Hunter Valley on December 6, The Regatta Grounds, Hobart on January 17, Peter Lehmann Wines in the Barossa Valley on January 31 and Sandalford Wines in Swan Valley February 7. Barnes and Icehouse frontman Iva Davies go way, way back to the late 70s when Chisel and Flowers (who became Icehouse in 1981) were both signed to Dirty Pool. That independent booking agency completely disrupted the Australian music industry in favour of artists getting the primary share of ticket sales instead of agents and venues. “At the time Premier Artists had a stranglehold on the industry and then the managers of the two biggest band in the country, Cold Chisel and The Angels decided to break away and form their own agency,” Davies recalled. “And they were looking for a younger band, so the ‘apprentices’ they found was Flowers.” Barnes said Flowers became regular openers for Chisel shows as the synth band’s popularity grew off the back of singles Can’t Help Myself, We Can Get Together and Walls. The rocker said he even offered up his bedroom as a location for the video shoot for Walls. “Jane and I lived in this house just around the corner from Dirty Pool, and our bedroom was in a small ballroom, it was beautiful, and Iva came and filmed there,” Barnes recalled. “So we were mates and label buddies in Dirty Pool, fighting against the monopolies and toured a lot together. Iva was there when I met Jane in Canberra in 1979!” Working Class Man has long been regarded as Barnes’ signature song, the anthem to unite not only his audience in loud crowd karaoke at his shows, but instantly recognised from the opening line “Working hard to make a living.” But the truth is the song isn’t about Barnes. It was written by Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 1985 after a conversation with the Aussie rocker about his fans. “He was really interested because he had heard they were wild audiences in Australia and I don’t think Journey had ever played here,” Barnes said. “I told him about my audience being hard working, doing nine-to-five in factories, and come Saturday night, kicking their heels up and going berserk. You could see him taking it all in. “About a week later, he rang up and said ‘I’ve written a song for you called Working Class Man.’ And my immediate gut reaction was, ‘Oh f …, he’s written a song about me called Working Class Man, how cliche is that?’ “And he said ‘It’s not about you, it is about your audience.’ When I heard the demo, it was just incredible. The minute I heard it, I knew that it was sort of a career-defining song.” Icehouse also proved wildly popular with the more than 2.6 million voters for the Hottest 100 Australian Songs countdown last weekend, with the evocative classic Great Southern Land peaking at No. 35. While these revered artists may have cut their teeth in Australia’s notorious beer barns in the 80s, now they get to play wineries. The first shot at tickets will be via the Telstra Plus Member presale on August 4 from 10am via telstra.com/music MG Live, Face To Face Touring, and Jimmy Barnes fan club presales open on August 6 ahead of the general sale from 2pm on August 7.

    "content": "The Grammy winner took the stage at 2:30am at Essence Fest, performing to a near-empty stadium after hours of chaos. Justice for Lauryn Hill. The Grammy Award winner, 50, took the stage at the 2025 Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans over the weekend hours later than expected, forcing her to perform in front of a nearly-empty crowd at Caesars Superdome. Hill’s set was supposed to take place late Friday night as part of the rest of the line-up, which included GloRilla, the Isley Brothers, Babyface, Maxwell, Lucky Daye and Psiryn. However, the event ran late and most of the performers didn’t go onstage until at least an hour after they were scheduled to do so. In Hill’s case, she finally started her set at 2:30am on Saturday, just minutes after the festival announced there were “technical difficulties.” By that time, only several hundred people were in the stadium, which can accommodate over 80,000 people. Hill’s performance lasted about an hour and ended at around 3:37am, according to Nola.com. Despite the delay, Hill put on an electric performance for the crowd. She wore a blue polka dot full-length dress with a gele atop her head as she sang some of her classics including Ex-Factor from her critically acclaimed debut album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Hill even brought out her sons Zion Marley, 27, and YG Marley, 23, onstage to perform with her. After belting out a rendition of Killing Me Softly With His Song as a tribute to the late Roberta Flack, Hill took a request from the crowd for her final song of the night. She chose Fu-Gee-La, a song by her hip-hop group, the Fugees. Following the event, Essence Festival released a statement defending Hill over her delayed performance. “Family is family and around here we protect our own no matter what the PEOPLE have to say,” the festival wrote on Instagram Sunday. “Let’s be very clear — WE don’t play about Ms. Lauryn Hill. Not for clicks. Not for headlines.” “She arrived on schedule, stepped on that stage, and delivered the kind of performance only a legend can,” the statement continued. “The delay? Not hers. We will take that. The moment? One for the books. The legacy? Still unmatched.” “Put some respect on her name. Keep the takes, but keep her out of them,” the festival added. “All love and deep profound admiration for Ms. Lauryn Hill.” Hill’s devoted fans showed her support on social media as well. “If I’m Lauryn Hill, I’m probably cussing out Essence cause this is just unacceptable,” one fan wrote on X. “It’s very easy to get Lauryn Hill trending with false narratives. Let’s provide the facts. The entire festival was pushed back,” another fan said. “This was literally not her fault.” Someone else tweeted, “I think a few blogs and publications owe Ms. Lauryn Hill an apology. I know she’s had TERRIBLE time problems in the past, but that Essence Fest situation didn’t sound like it was on her. No need for them (or the event) to use her as a scapegoat.” Ironically, Hill has a history of being late for performances. She even addressed her constant tardiness during a delayed concert in Los Angeles in November 2023. “Yo, y’all lucky I make it on this blood ras stage every night,” Hill reportedly told the crowd at the time. “I don’t do it because they let me do it. I do it because I stand here in the name of God and I do it.” This article originally appeared in New York Post and has been republished with permission. To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "A massive leak from the so-called Panama Playlist database has exposed the private music tastes of some of the world’s most powerful figures. Vice President JD Vance is a big fan of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt gets pumped up with Beyonce’s “Run the World (Girls)” — and there’s one very prominent politician who loves Nelly’s “Hot In Herre.” That’s all according to the Panama Playlists — a site that quietly went live Wednesday and claims to reveal the private music tastes of a slew of public figures. “I found the real Spotify accounts of celebrities, politicians, and journalists. “Many use their real names. With a little sleuthing, I could say with near-certainty: yep, this is them,” the anonymous eavesdropper wrote. “We’ve been scraping their accounts since summer 2024. “Playlists, live listening feed, everything. I know what songs they played, when, and how many times,” they wrote, also stating the project has not affiliation with company “Spotify.” The anonymous researcher told The Post that they became convinced in the authenticity of each account as the months of monitoring went on. “I gained confidence in each person by looking at lots of signals. An example is Pam Bondi. Her longtime partner is John Wakefield, and her profile has an old playlist called “john” and an old shared playlist with a user named ‘John Wakefield,’ so that gives me a lot of confidence it is her account.” “Karoline Leavitt’s profile has a playlist called ‘Baby Shower,’ and she had a baby a month after the playlist was made,” the owner of the website told The Post, emphasising they only collected publicly available information. It all seems to be a bit of summer fun, that reveals the questionable, ironic and sometimes too-on-the-nose music choices of America’s rich and powerful. “Heard of the Panama Papers? That exposed offshore bank accounts. This is about onshore vibes,” the site says. Here is a sample of what “Panama Playlists” found. Vice President JD Vance is a fan of the songs “I Want It That Way” by the Backstreet Boys and “One Time” by Justin Bieber, both of which appear on his oft-listened to “Making Dinner” playlist. The millennial veep also appears to be a fan of pop-punk, with several songs from the early aughts favourite Death Cab for Cutie appearing on his playlist “Gold On The Ceiling.” On that playlist, Vance shows off an eclectic taste in tunes, selecting songs “Fade Into You” by Mazzy Star, “Pepper,” by Butthole Surfers, “Signs” by band Tesla, and “Take a Walk” from Passion Pit. FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has three public playlists — “rap” “soft” and “loud” — which feature plenty of Eminem, also Death Cab for Cutie, and song “Young Dumb, Broke” from Khalid. Karoline Leavitt had the songs “Run the World (Girls)” by Beyonce and “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” from Cyndi Lauper on her “Baby Shower” playlist. Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson’s liked tracks on his Pandora account include “Parachutes” from the movie “Air Force One” and the “Finding Nemo/Nemo Egg” theme performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. He’s also into “One Night Love Affair” by Bryan Adams and “May It Be” by Enya. Social media gadfly Taylor Lorenz’s public playlists include “Older Millenial College Rager TBT” and “Breakup Songs” —- but her “Favs” include tracks “Romeo and Juliet” from Dire Straits and “You Can Get It If You Really Want” from reggae legend Jimmy Cliff. Pam Bondi prefers the more upbeat tracks on her playlist named “Pam” — including Nelly’s immortal jam “Hot In Herre,” “Hands to Myself” by Selena Gomez, and “Fix My Eyes” from band For King & Country.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s “My Shazam Tracks” — meaning songs he likely looked up — include the well-known “Get Ur Freak On” by Missy Elliott, “Make Me Feel Your Love,” by Adele, and “Vivir Mi Vida” from Marc Anthony. Coinsbase CEO Brian Armstrong has a playlist called “Repeat” that is the song “Long Way Home” by Gareth Emery saved 60 times. And Florida Governer Ron DeSantis is a major classic rock fan with his only public playlist featuring iconic songs “Ring of Fire” by Johnny Cash, “Southern Nights” from the rhinestone cowboy Glen Campbell, and The Charlie Daniels Band’s “The Devil Went Down To Georgia.” This story first appeared in the New York Post and was republished with permission.

Lopez, 56, initially gasped while attempting to grab the skirt before it hit the floor. She quickly changed her demeanour and flaunted her figure around the stage, wearing only the briefs, a green bedazzled bra, long green gloves and tights. “I’m here in my underwear,” the pop star told the crowd.

However, after the skirt didn’t latch, Lopez took it off and threw it into the audience. Joking about the incident, she told the crowd, “I’m glad that they reinforced that costume. And I’m glad I had underwear on. I don’t usually wear underwear.” Several fans praised the actress’ graceful reaction, with one commenting on Instagram, “She is everything that is right in this world.” “Life is too short love how she and her staffs [sic] handle it,” another gushed. “She’s so cute, then she threw it out into the crowd.

    "content": "The retailers are beefing up an aisle in response to an increased demand for a product Aussies previously wouldn’t buy at the supermarket. Supermarkets were once just a place to pick up groceries, but now shoppers are flocking to the aisles to pick up a very different kind of product. The beauty offerings at retailers such as Coles and Woolworths has been rapidly expanding in recent years, with consumers now given more options than ever when it comes to skin, hair and body care. And data shows the beefed-up range is a huge success with shoppers, with Woolies revealing it has seen a “double-digit growth in skin care in the past quarter alone”. “We’re focused on bringing the latest on-trend beauty brands and skincare products to our stores so that our customers can enjoy affordable luxuries at home,” a spokesperson for the supermarket giant told news.com.au’s The Beauty Diary. “As well as being affordable, we find that customers enjoy the convenience of picking up all their beauty and skincare needs in one shop.” The growing interest in the beauty aisle has seen Woolworths secure deals to be the first Australian retailer stocking several international brands, including Tree Hut, Daise and Billie, which the supermarket said has been driving new customers through its doors. It’s not just skincare that is getting snapped up, with “the fresh food people” selling around 8000 mascaras every day – that’s three million mascaras a year. “Customers love that they can also take advantage of our Everyday Rewards program to earn points to spend back in store, as well as keeping an eye out for our weekly catalogue for specials,” the spokesperson said. “On top of our supermarkets, Big W also sells a huge range of beauty products, making it easier for customers to get their hands on these popular brands.” Coles is experiencing a similar surge in customer demand for beauty products, with the retailer stating that economic strain on Aussie households is a key part of the change to shopping habits. “At a time when cost of living pressures remain a challenge for many people, Coles is committed to helping with a range of great value products across the supermarket and that includes in the beauty aisle,” a spokesperson told The Beauty Diary. “Supermarket beauty brands are a great alternative for customers wanting to still indulge and experience high-quality beauty products, but at an affordable price.” But it’s not just the selection of products that is on the up, but the quality too, with Aussies regularly raving about supermarket beauty buys that exceed expectation. One brand that is regularly praised for being “insanely effective” is Dermal Therapy, an affordable Australian skincare brand with an extensive range, much of which is sold in Coles and Woolies. Founded by Steven and Shelley Sher, Dermal Therapy has been steadily increasing its own product range recently, with the launch of its Overnight Face Mask and a line of Tinted Lip Balms. “Whilst our brand was and still is predominantly pharmacy focused, we understand that our customers don’t always have time to go to multiple stores and being able to add your favourite skincare line to your grocery trolley is an option people would like to have,” Mrs Sher told The Beauty Diary. “We pride ourselves on our accessibility across multiple retailers instore and online.” The brand’s ethos of “being affordable and highly effective” stems from a “very personal experience of struggling to keep our son’s eczema under control when he was a toddler”, Mrs Sher explained, stating it caused a financial and emotional toll that she and her husband used to create the Dermal Therapy range. “We used the pain of our experience and turned it into our passion to make a real positive change in the therapeutic skincare space, which we are proud to say with almost 100 products now in our range, and many thousands of happy customers – we really do deliver on our ‘Dermal Therapy Promise’, which is developing seriously good skincare, that actually works.” It appears to be paying off for the brand, with customers regularly raving about its line on social media. Several of its products have gone viral on TikTok in the last year, including the Crystal Deodorant roll-on and its Original Lip Balm. “It’s the absolute best,” wrote one delighted customer. “This brand is so unsexy but it doesn’t matter because it works,” claimed another. Mrs Sher said it always makes her day when she sees a positive review, adding feedback can often help them decide what new product to bring out next. “Following on from our hugely successful overnight lip mask, we saw the potential in an overnight face mask,” she said, explaining the story behind the brand’s newest product. “We had already made inroads into face care both through our lip balms and with our very dry face cream so knew that this was something that would be welcomed by consumers. “The overnight face mask contains Hyalaronic Acid, Ceramides, Peptides, Collagen & Urea plus much more. In total there are over 30 skin loving ingredients packed into that little tube.” If you have a question about a beauty product or an item you’d like to see road-tested in The Beauty Diary, let us know.

    "content": "A rare side effect from COVID-19 vaccines has caught the attention of health experts, after a number of people reported unusual symptoms. New research is calling for further study on a possible link between COVID-19 jabs and long-term vision issues. While vaccines have been vital in fighting the pandemic, emerging data could mean we’re not out of the woods yet. Between January 2021 and January 2023, 20 peer-reviewed studies looked into eye problems reported by 243 people aged 18 to 84 who had received COVID-19 vaccines. Almost half of these patients - 42 per cent - had the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which was the main vaccine rolled out in Australia, the USA, the UK, and much of Europe. What jumps out is inflammation. Nearly half of the patients reported experiencing ocular inflammatory conditions like uveitis, an irritation deep inside the eye. Another 24 per cent were said to have suffered optic neuritis, a swelling of the optic nerve that can cause pain and threaten vision. Herpetic eye disease, caused by the herpes virus attacking the eye, showed up in 14 per cent of cases, triggering redness, pain, and discomfort. About 10 per cent documented retinal circulation issues - blockages in the eye’s arteries or veins that can trigger sudden vision loss. And there were also a few rare cases where patients were noted to exhibit retina-related problems causing “dark spots” or “blind patches”. For the best lifestyle coverage in Australia - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. But the most notable observations come from a recent Turkish study that tracked 64 patients before and after their two mRNA vaccine doses. Using detailed eye scans, researchers found an 8 per cent drop in the cornea’s endothelial cell count - the cells responsible for keeping the cornea clear. These cells don’t regenerate, and losing too many can permanently impair vision. To put that into perspective, healthy adults usually have between 2000 and 3000 of these cells per square millimetre. After vaccination, the average dropped from 2597 to 2378. While these numbers are still considered safe for most, the decline could be a warning sign for people with pre-existing eye conditions or those who have had eye surgeries like LASIK, cataract removal, or corneal transplants. Researchers also noted that corneas thickened by around 2 per cent after vaccination - a sign of possible swelling. The honeycomb shape of the endothelial cells became distorted, and the size differences between individual cells increased, which are both signs of cellular stress. Though none of the study participants reported immediate vision problems, experts warn that long-term structural changes to the cornea could lead to lasting damage, especially in vulnerable patients. Dr Fatma Sümer and Sevgi Subasi, authors of the study published in Ophthalmic Epidemiology, stressed the need for careful observation: “The endothelium should be closely monitored in those with a low endothelial count or who have had a corneal graft.” According to Healthline, eye complications after vaccination are rare and appear to be driven by an overactive immune response. Symptoms can include blurred vision, light sensitivity, redness, eye pain, shingles around the eye, or reactivated herpes infections. In even rarer cases, the immune system may reject a previously transplanted cornea, risking vision loss and graft failure. This means the transplanted cornea loses its clarity and function, leading to impaired vision and the potential need for further treatment or surgery. These findings are not conclusive, and experts do not advise people to skip their COVID vaccine shots — far from it. But they are urging doctors and patients to not ignore these subtle warning signs. Those who have had prior eye surgery, suffer from chronic eye disease, or notice persistent blurry vision after vaccination are advised to be checked, because even small changes inside your eyes can have big consequences down the road According to safety reports from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), “vaccination is the most effective way to reduce deaths and severe illness from infection.” Like all medicines, the TGA notes, “COVID-19 vaccines may cause some side effects. “The most frequently reported include injection-site reactions (such as a sore arm) and more general symptoms, like headache, muscle pain, fever and chills.” The TGA closely monitors reports of adverse events to the COVID-19 vaccines and emphasises that “the protective benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks.” To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Collapsed Australian fashion label Tigerlily has emerged from a turbulent two-year period to make a dramatic retail comeback just in time for a milestone anniversary. Australian swimwear and apparel brand Tigerlily is set to make its return to Australian shops this Friday, just in time to celebrate its 25th anniversary. After a bumpy two-year period, the brand “all about beach lifestyle” will officially reopen down under. Customers will be able to purchase Tigerlily’s signature bikinis, swimwear, and accessories online and through select retail partners, including department store giant Myer. Tigerlily general manager Prue Slocombe exclusively told NewWire the brand is looking to bring back its “personality” back as it returns. “What we are looking to do with Tigerlily is take it back to that really vibrant, fun personality that it had 10-15 years ago when it was in its prime,” she said. Ms Slocombe said success for the brand will be built on having a customer first approach and staying authentic to customers. “From there we would really love to see some aggressive growth. There is absolutely appetite for a considered retail approach. As part of its anniversary celebrations, the brand will be relaunching some of their best-selling heritage prints. “When we looked through the archives, it was like kids in a candy store looking at all the prints, so we will be tapping into that,” she said. Tigerlily believes the key to a successful relaunch will be offering its unique design and quality garments at the right price, as Australians continue to battle through cost of living pressures. “Quality is king,” Ms Slocombe told NewsWire. “You could see a bikini on the beach and you knew it was Tigerlily and not every brand has that. “All our garments have beautifully finished details, metal badging, metal trims, gorgeous hardware, blanket stitching, patchwork prints, that’s what we are known for and the learnings from the past are we need to retain those parts of the brand.” Tigerlily was founded in 2000 by model, fashion designer and television personality Jodhi Meares. Ms Slocombe said the business coming back 25 years after the brand Ms Meares built couldn’t be better timing. “We very luckily came back at the ... 25th anniversary, so having that nice milestone feels like a nice time to relaunch,” she said. “Also boho is trending right now, so combined it feels like the stars have aligned for us.” Ms Slocombe said the Australian fashion industry as a whole is on the rebound following a leaner time during Covid. “There is something nice about being able to celebrate the heritage brands of Australian fashion and they are still in demand,” she said. “It shows if you’re a strong brand that stays true to its customers and knows its space then brands can really stand the test of time. The relaunch follows a turbulent few years for the fashion brand. First launched in 2000 on the shores of Bondi Beach the brand quickly grew before being bought by fellow Australian fashion label Billabong in 2017. Ten years later Tigerlily changed hands again when Crescent Capital Partners bought it out for $60m. Tigerlily faced significant hurdles, ultimately collapsing in March 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic severely impacted the global retail and fashion sectors. In 2021, the business moved to eco-friendly fabrics including organic materials and natural fibres. While the brand briefly restructured post-Covid, it again fell into financial difficulties and ultimately stopped trading in early 2024. Prior to collapsing, Tigerlily operated 10 stores and had 40 wholesale partners in Australia and the US as well as an online presence. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

An Australian artist who spends most of their time living in the United States has revealed a hilarious cultural difference — and many Aussies don’t even realise it’s a “weird” tradition. G Flip, who is originally from Melbourne, is largely based in the US and is married to American Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause. The Disco Cowboy singer, who uses they/them pronouns, and the reality TV star recently celebrated their third marriage ceremony together. During their time together, the couple has discovered some crazy cultural differences between Australia and the United States. “I’m an Aussie who lives in America and I have an American wife and I think one of the funniest things to explain about Australian culture is that you can win a meat tray in the pub,” the singer and drummer said. “So you go to the pub and they hand out raffle tickets to win a meat tray. And you just win a tray of various meats and sausages. “You go home with the meat tray. And everyone who’s American that I’ve ever told that to is like, ‘What the f***.” G Flip said the first time Stause came to Australia, they took her to a pub in Darwin and they didn’t win the meat tray. The musician asked if anywhere else in the world had a similar practice. Aussies quickly weighed in on the iconic tradition. “It’s also compulsory to say to winners ‘barby at yours tomorrow!’ whether you know them or not,” one person declared. Another said: “I wouldn’t say this is everywhere in Canada but where I live some bars/pubs have what we call Porchetta Bingo and if you win you get a basket full of Porchetta. Pairs perfect with cold beer.” Someone else commented: “Texas does meat raffles. I’ve always thought it was very strange.” “And I’m a vegetarian but I’m buying a ticket every time,” one social media user commented. One said: “I was at a pub on Monday and the raffle didn’t have a meat tray and I was so confused! No Sussan I don’t want $20 I want meat!” “Even funnier when you have to carry it around for the rest of the night/pub crawl and get random photos taken with the meat tray being carried by different people all night,” another said. One commented: “The sadness when you leave it behind the bar in the fridge while you’re there, and then forget to pick it up before you leave.” “And, the stakes are higher at Christmas time with legs of ham,” one said. Another commented: “As an Aussie, I never realised this was weird hahahaha.” Even Stause herself commented on her wife’s clip, writing: “Even though I know it will give me meat sweats and likely food poisoning, I still want to win one.” Australia Post faces mounting criticism after a resident's desperate attempt to receive their parcel exposes widespread delivery failures.

    "content": "An Aussie comedian who “missed out” on a viral product at the hardware store was gobsmacked when a staffer went “above and beyond”. Christian Hull has been blown away by a Bunnings worker who went “above and beyond” to secure him a cult item during a nationwide frenzy. The Aussie comedian was among the thousands of shoppers who visited the retailer on Wednesday desperate to get their hands on its range of limited-edition Bluey products that had returned to shelves. The Brisbane based celebrity, who is a huge fan of popular children’s TV show, missed out on the four garden gnomes when released last year, and turned to his army of loyal fans to help him locate the “hot-ticket” items. His quest was a success, but not before he went viral multiple times with the extreme lengths he took – including flying to Tassie to do a deal on a street corner. After hearing Bunnings had now released three new outdoor figurines based on the show’s characters, he headed straight over to his local store, only to discover stock had been cleared out during a “6am rush”. For the best lifestyle coverage in Australia – download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. Little did he know though, that a Bunnings employee at the Newstead, Queensland, store named Alicia, had already stashed the two new bride and groom gnomes – dubbed “husbands” on Bluey – for him. And her actions have earned huge praise from Hull’s fans. “I still cannot believe my luck,” he wrote on social media. “This morning at 6am Bunnings opened with new Bluey gnomes (husbands) and people bought them out. “I woke up at 9am and thought, bugger I’ve missed out. I wandered into my local just to check to see if by sheer chance there was some left. There wasn’t. “As I looked at the pile of gnomes I already had, deflated, Leesh, a Bunnings Newstead team member said ‘follow me’ …” Alongside his post was a 3 minute video Hull filmed of his venture to the hardware store, which showed the comedian’s rollercoaster ride of emotions as he went from believing he’d “missed out” to a tear-filled but delighted Bluey fan. MORE: Govt loans Bunnings $100m in bombshell deal Hill’s fans flooded the comments section of his video on Facebook and TikTok, declaring Alicia a “legend” who deserved a pay rise. “It’s rare these days people make the effort to give these amazing staff members proper formal compliments, please can you contact Bunnings head office and put in a compliment for Alicia,” one said. “Alicia out here doing the Lords work,” remarked another. As someone else declared: “ALISHA NEEDS A PAYRISE!! HOW AWESOME IS SHE?” Hull has since confirmed he has sent a glowing feedback form to Bunnings for the staffer who made his day – and also called on the Australian retailer to “give a pay rise” to the star worker. “Legitimately, hand on heart, was going to film my disappointment after I sleep in, through the gnome buying craze, and miss out yet again,” he said in the clip. “Sometimes I really love people, and Leesh … oh my God I could cry with absolute joy and happiness.” MORE: $8m blow out in Bunnings sell-off war Bunnings has once again transformed stores in Australia and New Zealand into “Hammerbarn”, a fictional DIY store featured in the popular children's TV show, Bluey for the month of August following its success last year. As well as rebranding shop fronts and hosting Bluey-themed kids DIY workshops and scavenger hunts, Bunnings is selling a limited-edition product range – including the garden gnomes based on the show’s characters which previously sparked a mad frenzy. The return of the $19 figurines – dubbed “husbands” in one Bluey episode – has caused a similar reaction, with shoppers rushing to stores in the early hours in a bid to snag one. “Went at 6am and it was a fight to get one,” reported one shopper on Facebook. “There was a rush at 6am in Kirrawee, they are all gone now,” another added. As one commented: “I missed out last year, am going to try my luck later.” Bunnings said that in order to avoid customers bulk-buying the limited-edition product, it had introduced a purchase limit of 4 gnomes per customer. But it appears to have done little to stop those hoping to cash-in on the item’s popularity, with many of the gnomes already appearing on eBay with asking prices as high as $1000. This time around there are 7 different characters available, including the 3 new additions – Gerald and Bride and Groom Gnomes, which Bunnings said it was “expecting to be hot property”. “It’s clear how much fans connect with the show given how quickly last year’s Bluey gnomes flew off the shelves,” Justine Mills, Bunnings General Manager Marketing, said. “We know they will be eager to build on their collections, and we’re excited to see how customers respond to our new range and in-store activities.” Other items available in the beloved collaboration include Hammerbarn branded socks, key rings, bucket hats and kiddo’s tote bags that are available across all stores, while stock lasts. A warning has been issued about a popular bin hack to make getting to the kerb a little easier on bin night. The price tag of one item spotted in a popular DIY chain has raised eyebrows — but some have argued it was fair. One fed-up bloke is sick of city slickers ignoring one of the country’s most basic rules. And it seems the internet agrees with him. Our Apps"

    "content": "From who turns up and what actually goes on, to the truth behind those “moaning” complaints. If you think festival season is all about flower crowns and muddy fields, think again. Deep in England’s Lincolnshire countryside, there’s a gathering in the sleepy town of Allington that only those “in the know” dare to visit. Dubbed as “Glastonbury with orgies and Love Island-style beauties,” Swingathon, now in its fifth year, isn’t your typical festival. But speaking to news.com.au’s From the Newsroom podcast, its organiser, Matt Cole, insists it still has elements of a standard festival. “It’s got live music and entertainment, but it’s for people in the lifestyle,” Mr Cole told the podcast. For those not familiar with “the lifestyle”, swinging involves people from all walks of life – LGBTQIA+, queer, couples, and anyone willing to explore non-monogamy. The three-day event held last weekend marked its biggest turnout yet, with nearly 1000 revellers descending on the small town – which was more than the entire local population. But despite its fun ethos, the event drew serious complaints last year from nearby residents who claimed they heard loud, hours-long “moaning” sounds coming from the campgrounds. Mr Cole insists that this was only half true. “Yes, we had (moaning), but the complaints are basically a lie. We are three miles (4.8km) from the nearest village, so if anyone can scream that loud … that’s a scream,” he laughed. He believes that much of the negative press comes from locals disagreeing with the festival’s premise. The event is mainly made up of couples, with a two-person ticket setting you back around $470 AUD and singles around $400. This year, there were around 100 single men and 50-60 single women in attendance. In terms of the age bracket, the average age is 37, which is much younger than many would expect. “The youngest that we let in was 21 and the oldest guy was 69,” he shared. So what actually goes on behind the gates? By day, the festival – which sees people rock up in anything from their birthday suits, lingerie and fancy dress – hosts lots of different events. “We have a UV party, a social night, workshops, live talks, and demonstrations,” Mr Cole explains. But they’re not just standard demonstrations. “Some of them might be like flogging, wax play or rope play,” he says. “Or pole dancing, burlesque classes and massage classes”. There are also hot tubs, sex games, foam parties, and mobile dungeons. Butt plug bingo is one of the more interesting events, which is bingo with a cheeky twist to it (you win the adult-themed toy at the end). In terms of the actual swinging, there are sanctioned tents where people can go if they’re interested in exploring some adult fun. “It’s all controlled,” Mr Cole explains. “There’s group tents, then there’s voyeur tents – all sorts of tents for everybody”. But before you think it’s all debauchery, Mr Cole says that many don’t even go for that reason. Many simply attend for the liberating, body positivity aspect. “They just go to be around like-minded people,” he says. “It’s not what people think. You don’t just turn up and start swinging. A lot of friendships get made, and people leave with so much more confidence than when they started.” They were once sex worker “besties”, but Annie Knight says her former co-star has gone too far, warning Bonnie Blue’s “ship is going down”. Locals are furious after a raunchy event with over 1000 attendees decscended on its town filling the streets with “moaning” sounds. Mark Latham has claimed that ‘everyone’ engages in this sex act at work – but is that true? And is it ever appropriate? Our Apps"

    "content": "They say people are lazy when they don’t lift a finger but fitness influencer Liu Weiqiang’s finger is not like everyone elses. Liu Weiqiang has broken a Guinness World record, and all he had to do was, quite literally, lift a finger. The Chinese fitness influencer deadlifted a jaw-dropping 144 kilograms with just his middle finger, breaking the previous record set by Egmond Molina, who achieved a one-finger deadlift of 138.5 kilograms in March 2024. To put 144 kilograms into perspective, that’s roughly the weight of a washer and dryer combo, a bathtub full of water, a small motorbike, or even two full kegs of beer. Yep. So, very impressive. To achieve this whopping accomplishment, Liu built a weighted device he could lift with just one finger. He clipped a carabiner to a sturdy fitness pole and loaded it with four 25 kilogram plates and two 20 kilogram plates. Then, while in a deadlift position - legs apart and a neutral spine - he looped his right middle finger around the carabiner and pulled the weight up, his face the picture of pain as he grimaced through the movement. The entire lift took almost an entire 10 seconds. For the best lifestyle coverage in Australia - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. Impressive as the feat is, Liu is no stranger to breaking world records. In 2023, he set eight Guinness World Records, including the heaviest weighted pull up (109.20 kg), most pull ups in one minute with a 36 kilogram pack (25 pull ups), and the most ring dips in one minute carrying a 45 kilogram pack (20 dips). Contrary to his impressive rep sheet, the strongman did not set out with the intention of setting such records. “Due to the pressures of work and the natural ageing process, I found myself with less energy for fitness than before,” Weiqiang previously told Guinness World Records. “I believed that my training performances were already approaching record levels, so I decided to put myself to the test. “I chose several challenges with a higher chance of success and scheduled them during the beginning of this year’s vacation. “Since starting my job, I’ve had less time for fitness, and I’ve felt a bit slack. However, after proving myself through these records, I find fitness to be relaxing and enjoyable.” Aussies have also gotten a piece of the world record pie as well. In 2023, Brisbane accountant Lucas Helmke went down in history after beating the world record for the most push-ups in one hour as he performed 3206 pushups in 60 minutes. For those having trouble wrapping your head around that figure, that’s an average of 53 per minute. The previous record of 3182 was set by another Aussie, Adelaide mechanic Daniel Scali, in April 2022. Mr Helmke attempted this record to “provide inspiration” for his one-year-old son in a bid to “show him nothing is impossible”. The Queensland man trained for three years to break the record, with the official attempt taking place at powerlifting gym Iron Underground, Brisbane. To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Thaddeus was born from an embryo frozen before either of his parents even started school. The world’s “oldest baby” has been born from an embryo frozen before either of his parents even started school. Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was delivered on July 26 to parents Lindsey and Tim Pierce, of Ohio – over three decades after his embryo was frozen. The tot, who has broken the record for the oldest baby, even has a 30-year-old sister – who is now a mum herself to a 10-year-old girl, The Sun reports. The title was previously held by twins who were created from embryos frozen 30 years before their birth. Lindsay told MIT Technology Review: “We didn’t go into it thinking we would break any records. We just wanted a baby.” Thaddeus’s embryo was created along with three others during a course of IVF in the 1990s for Linda Archerd and her then-husband. One of the embryos was implanted into Linda who conceived her now 30-year-old daughter. The remaining embryos were put in long-term storage before being put up for embryo adoption when Linda and her partner separated. Embryo adoptions are more typical in the US – particularly at Christian clinics – to help families struggling to conceive. After seven years trying for a baby, Lindsey and Tim signed up for the same program and were offered Thaddeus’s embryo. “We had a rough birth, but we’re both doing well now,” Lindsey said. “He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby,” she added. ‘Snow babbies’ In 2017, a baby girl was born from a 25-year-old embryo in what was then a world first in the US. Little Emma Wren Gibson weighed 6lbs 8oz (about 2.9kg) and measured 20 inches (about 50cm) long when she was born. Her parents, Tina and Benjamin Gibson, said their daughter’s record status was their last priority, focusing only on her health, adding they felt “thankful and blessed” to have her. They said they were surprised when they were told the exact age of the embryo, thawed on March 13 at the National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC). “Do you realise I’m only 25? This embryo and I could have been best friends,” Tina told CNN. Tina, who was 26 at the time, said she just wanted a baby and didn’t care if it was going to be a world record or not. “We’re just so thankful and blessed. She’s a precious Christmas gift from the Lord.” Baby Emma was created via IVF for another couple but had been left in storage for someone else. Embryos like this are called “snow babies” – potential human lives left on ice waiting to be born. Seven years ago Tina and Benjamin got married knowing they would not be able to have biological children as Benjamin has cystic fibrosis. They had fostered several children and were planning on adoption before having the embryo implanted. This article originally appeared in The Sun and has been reproduced with permission.

    "content": "A viral app designed to help women expose red-flag men has become a red flag itself after a devastating data breach saw tens of thousands of private images leaked. A once-empowering app designed to protect women from catfishers, criminals and creeps has turned into a privacy nightmare. Tea Dating Advice, the female-only app that soared to popularity this July thanks to TikTok, was hailed a game-changer in identifying dodgy men and enabling women to “swipe safely.” The Yelp-style platform grants women access to a forum where they can post anonymous ratings of men they’re seeing and ask other women for “tea” - aka gossip/dirt. Think of it like writing a scathing review of that regretful Tinder date you went on with the foot-fetish guy, or simply venting about your ex. The app is armed with AI-powered features to help you steer clear of danger in the chaos of modern dating: including background checks, reverse image lookups, sex offender registry searches, and the ability to set alerts on men’s names. The “revolutionary” dating tool had a rapid rise, but an equally fast downfall. Youth and pop culture magazine Dazed argued that the app’s model teeters on “digital vigilantism”, allowing women to post photos of men without their consent, raising serious privacy questions. And now those very concerns are front and centre. Quietly launched in 2023 by tech founder Sean Cook, Tea remained under the radar, only rocketing to number one on Apple’s US App Store at the beginning of July 2025. Last Friday, the company confirmed it suffered “unauthorised access to an archived data system”, exposing roughly 72,000 userâ€‘submitted images. 13,000 selfies and photo IDs used for verification, plus 59,000 images from posts, comments and direct messages dating back over two years. Tea’sInstagram statement insisted the breach affected only a “legacy storage system” and that users who signed up after February 2024 were not impacted. “We’ve acted fast and we’re working with some of the most trusted cybersecurity experts,” the company said. Tea claims it stored those images to comply with cyber-bullying prevention laws. But many ‘Tea Party Girls’ have questioned - if photo IDs were supposed to be deleted after verification, why did thousands remain in an exposed archive? In 2023, the app reportedly stopped requiring photo IDs for new signups, yet the breached data set still contained thousands of them. While Tea was celebrating two million new users, an anonymous 4chan user posted a database of photos, including location-tied data and even a map - which sparked heated discussion across X and Facebook. These posts have since been removed. It’s likely no coincidence that 4chan, infamous for online harassment, was a vocal critic of the app, with some users calling for it to be hacked in the days after it blew up on social media. Tea is just the latest target in a broader debate about women using tech to stay safe and the backlash that often follows. Apps and groups aimed at outing cheaters or dangerous men have gained traction on social media, but they’ve also triggered lawsuits, hate campaigns, and arguments about defamation and privacy. Cook said the app was born out of watching his mother’s “terrifying” experience with online dating. She was catfished and unknowingly interacted with men who had criminal histories. But sadly, in trying to fix one safety issue, Cook created another. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

    "content": "A warning has been issued about a popular bin hack to make getting to the kerb a little easier on bin night. It’s the bin hack that has been described as “genius” online, but a viral trick showing how to pull two of the household rubbish containers at once has prompted a waste management company to issue a warning. The unique method, shared by an Australian mum last week, involves connecting two bins together using the lids and hooking them to a car’s towbar in order to pull them both at the same time. But the hack, which was first popularised by an American content creator last year, has sparked a warning from Veolia, a waste management company that operates across Australia and New Zealand. “It’s not uncommon for people with long driveways to hitch their bins to the towbar of their vehicles; we have also seen bins towed by bicycles, propelled by leaf blowers, and even guided by electric skateboards,” the spokesperson told news.com.au. “But bins are designed to be used in the ‘normal’ way. That’s what we recommend to keep yourself safe and the place tidy.” The brand also suggested that anyone “struggling” to bring their bins back in should “get a neighbour to help”, stressing Aussies’ safety was its number one concern. “We all love our bins, but instead of giving them a tow take the opportunity to get those steps in and walk them to the kerb â€• just watch out for your shins,” the spokesperson added. Its comments come after a video went viral demonstrating how frustrated bin users could save time with the tedious task. “This is super niche, but this is something I wish I learnt sooner — how to drag two bins at the same time when you don’t have any hands,” the Aussie mum-of-two said on social media. “I just chuck the first lid inside the second [bin], close the second lid and yank it up so it’s giving a little piggy back and then off you go.” The mum then attached the bins to the trailer hitch on the back of her car, and then drove down the long drive way on what appeared to be a rural property. Despite concerns from officials, many social media users appreciated the information, declaring they would give it a crack themselves. “Love it. My son sits in the boot and pulls them up for me while I drive slowly,” one social media user said. Another added: “It didn’t work for me.” “I put a hook on the lower part of the red bin,” one commented. One social media user said: “OMG YES!!!! This is game changing living in a house with a battle axe driveway.” “OK genius but how bloody long is your driveway,” another commented. The “mind-blowing” tactic went viral in May last year after it was demonstrated by American creator Cade Grier, in a video that has been viewed tens of millions of times. An Aussie comedian who “missed out” on a viral product at the hardware store was gobsmacked when a staffer went “above and beyond”. The price tag of one item spotted in a popular DIY chain has raised eyebrows — but some have argued it was fair. One fed-up bloke is sick of city slickers ignoring one of the country’s most basic rules. And it seems the internet agrees with him. Our Apps"

    "content": "A pilates instructor has called out an all too common act that most of us are guilty of doing at least once during exercise. An Aussie pilates instructor has called out an all too common exercise act that most of us are guilty of. Adelle Petropoulos, 30, teaches pilates full time and does four classes a week. After a recent class, the Melbourne woman took to TikTok to rant about something she sees in the studio all the time. “If this ever happens in your pilates class, just stop moving. You’ve done your class, everyone’s worked their little tushies off. The instructor’s put on harmonious music,” she said. “Find your quiet, still space — that is not instructions for you to get up, take your straps off and start cleaning your reformer.” She said all that can be heard throughout the quiet time at the end of the class are the sounds of cleaning spray and noisy personal items being bundled up. Ms Petropoulos advised people to either leave before the quiet music, or don’t come to the class at all as it interrupts others who choose to stay. Speaking to news.com.au, Ms Petropoulos said as an instructor her job is to create the best 45-minute experience for every person in the room. “When people start packing up before class ends, it disrupts that shared energy. It sends a message — intentionally or not — that the last few minutes don’t matter, when in fact, they’re often the most important: the wind-down, the breath work, the integration. Those moments are where the magic happens,” she told news.com.au. “It’s not just about etiquette, it’s about respect — for the practice, the instructor, and most importantly, for the people around you who are still trying to be present. Everyone deserves that full experience.” She said she understood that most people didn’t mean any harm by it, as they’re just busy, but it can be incredibly “disruptive” and “pulls others out of the moment”. Ms Petropoulos said most people agreed with what she said in the social media rant. Another action, from her perspective, that causes similar issues is using your phone in class. She mentioned that most people come in with a great energy and respect for the space. “Just a reminder that we’re all human — no one’s perfect! But if we can all stay present, support each other, and treat the space with care, it makes a huge difference. Pilates is about more than movement — it’s a shared community lead experience, and when we all show up fully, the energy in the room becomes something really special,” Ms Petropoulos said. Simon Ngo, from Flow Athletic, described Ms Petropoulos’ video as “spot on and accurate”. He said while leaving during the cool down portion of the class at Flow Athletic, due to the relative intensity of the classes, is quite rare it seems to be a fairly common occurrence in pilates in general. “I just feel like it’s a ‘what a shame’ moment. It’s as though you’ve gone to the effort of checking out the dessert menu but not ordered anything,” he said. “Or more accurately, like you’ve ordered the dessert, it’s arrived and you’ve decided to leave.” He said people should stick around for that part of the class, as it’s part of it for a reason. “If you don’t start a class without a warm up, why would you not finish with a cool down,” he said. “Otherwise, a class would have been advertised 5 mins shorter. Plus, your instructors probably would have gone above and beyond to plan these Zen closing out moments. “As much as people are time poor and, rather because of it, these few minutes of slowing down and reconnecting with ourselves are the stress-buster and self-care everyone needs in these of world of being busy today.” He said in 2025, securing a spot in a pilates class almost rivals getting into the housing market so, if you land a spot, “stay for the full experience”. They say people are lazy when they don’t lift a finger but fitness influencer Liu Weiqiang’s finger is not like everyone elses. It’s said you need to walk 10,000 steps a day, but a study has shown that this commonly spouted knowledge may be off the mark.

    "content": "The owners of a rapidly growing fast food chain have responded to customer concerns after an outbreak at one of its locations. The owners of a popular Aussie fast food chain, which recently landed in the US, have responded to customer concerns after an outbreak at one of its locations. Customers have expressed concerns regarding food poisoning at popular poke bowl establishment Fishbowl, which trades as Thisbowl in New York, following an issue in June. A staff member unwittingly came into work while unwell with a contagious illness at a location in New York City in June, and as a result other staff and customers became sick. One social media user, @anyonecancookforreal, asked: “Has anyone else in NYC gotten debilitating food poisoning from eating Thisbowl? “Three of my friends have gotten poisoned after eating there on separate occasions and we need to know if this is an epidemic.” The post prompted several people to express concerns over the quality of the food from the brand while others claimed to have had similar experiences since it opened in New York last year — often blaming the salmon, according to Grub Street. However, a spokesperson for Thisbowl has since responded to the complaints and given their account of what occurred. “Earlier this summer, one of Thisbowl’s employees was unknowingly infected with a contagious illness that affected some staff and customers,” a spokesperson said. “It was swiftly addressed with a third-party food safety expert and in full co-operation with the Department of Health, who found no issues with our food safety or handling practices. After a thorough investigation, the root cause of the issue was not related to food quality, freshness or supply, but a contagious illness that was unknowingly brought in by an employee. “The wellbeing of our customers and team remains our top priority, and we stand by the integrity of our operations.” The post from the social media user was linked to this outbreak. In Australia, there are 4.7 million cases of foodborne illness every year, according to the Food Authority. It accounts for 47,900 hospitalisations and 38 deaths. Around 80 products are recalled every year, mostly due to contamination or allergens that weren’t declared on the label. Issues with food are typically linked to mistakes when it comes to food handling or poor hygiene practices. At the end of last year, McDonald’s stores in the United States faced an e.coli outbreak due to an issue with onions and romaine lettuce. In 2018, Australia faced a listeria outbreak that was linked back to rockmelon. Nathan Dalah, one of the three founders of Fishbowl, told news.com.au that the business was still thriving, despite the concerns about food quality following the New York incident. “We’re coming off of one of the busiest days of the summer, probably one of the busiest lunches we’ve had. We’ve got a loyal customer base and they return at an incredibly high rate,” he said. Mr Dalah described what happened in June as an “outlier incident”, and gave insight into some of the food safety practices the business has. This includes an alarm sounding every 15 minutes to indicate staff need to change their gloves and another alarm every 20 minutes to indicate a need for sanitising. At the end of each day, after staff have cleaned and shut down the store, a commercial cleaning crew comes in and conducts a professional clean daily. In addition to this, as recently as last week, one store faced a gruelling four hour inspection by the New York Department of Health and received an A grade — the highest possible. These inspections are conducted at random. There is also a dedicated food safety team, news.com.au understands. Mr Dalah, who along with fellow founders Nic Pestalozzi and Casper Ettleson, still regularly works in stores serving customers. He revealed the business self reported to the Department of Health when the June issue was discovered. “We take this very seriously, we understand who our customer is and we understand the level of trust they put in us and as a result, food safety is the number one thing,” he said. He described the business as “intensely dedicated” to food safety. He said he understood the business served a “highly sensitive product” — such as sashimi grade salmon that is fresh daily and isn’t designed to be overcooked — and that factored into every decision. Just days after drawing huge crowds at 4am, an American chain that opened in Sydney has introduced strict rules amid Aussie’s complaints. Coles and Woolies staffers are exposing the bizarre things they’ve found at work, labelling shoppers who do it “grubs”. Are you guilty? Sydneysiders have called a suburban pub's steak special 'ridiculous', with the price tag higher than some of the city's most prestigious restaurants. Our Apps"

    "content": "Skims' new $88 face-shaping wrap has sold out worldwide, but is this medieval-looking device promoting harmful beauty standards? OPINION First, it was our waists in 2019 when Skims launched tummy control shapewear. Then in 2022, it was tiny bikinis, with Kim Kardashian, the brand’s founder, telling her customers, “I wanted to take away the anxiety of buying swimwear”. The bottoms were smaller than dental floss. 2023 arrived, and the brand, currently valued at nearly $5 billion, decided women must shun their current breasts in favour of having perkier ones with constantly erect nipples, thanks to their “revolutionary” nipple bra. This year alone, we’ve seen the launch of Skims’ bum-enhancing shorts with actual butt pads to give you that Brazilian Butt Lift look without the surgery. And then just months later, the ‘Ultimate Hip’ shorts launched, which feature foam pads at the hips to give you that cartoon-hourglass silhouette. Now it seems Skims has run out of body parts to mould, lift and enhance, so they’ve turned to … our face. Introducing Skims’ face shapewear Just when you thought your jawline was safe, this week, Skims launched its Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap. It’s no coincidence that the eerie-looking pull-on contraption closely resembles a post-surgery compression garment because it promises to sculpt the cheek, neck, and chin to give you that “snatched” appearance. Yes, the same look that the Kardashians achieved with much more expensive, potentially surgical treatments. But for the comparatively cheap price of $88, this face wrap promises to give you similar results, and all you have to do is wear it every day for the rest of your life! And while you sleep! Because women apparently aren’t ever allowed to rest. According to the Skims website, the product, which is made from the same fabric blend as its snatching bodysuits, is a “must have”. And given that it’s already sold out worldwide, clearly that messaging has worked. Naturally, the internet is flooded with opinions about the product, with camps clearly divided into: “This is what we’ve come to?” and “Actually, low-key love this”. And Skims definitely expected this debate, and dare I say it, planned it. A controversial product is in their DNA. But at what point do we say enough is enough? What are we going to see next? Shapewear for your feet, à la foot binding in Ancient China? Our heads can’t even relax now While it’s funny to joke and brush off these products as dystopian rage-bait, I feel like we actually need to call this out for what it is – Kardashian continuing to capitalise on women’s insecurities and the beauty standards she has been shaping forever. The Skims Instagram account has over six million followers, and Kardashian’s has 350 million, which means there’s a whole lot of women whose perception of beauty might be changed from a single post. Don’t get me wrong. I love a bit of a beauty gimmick, like dunking your face in ice water in the morning for a more ‘awake’ look. It’s relatively harmless, albeit momentarily painful, based in science and most importantly, it’s free. But this goes beyond an innocent wellness trend. When you start charging nearly a hundred dollars for something that looks like a medieval torture device while implying you’ll look snatched like Kim if you buy it, even though you won’t, it doesn’t just feel like a fun beauty trick – it feels harmful. ‘Relentless cycle of perfectionism’ Jaimee Krawitz, founder of the Hide N Seek Foundation, a national initiative aimed at changing the language around body image and eating disorders, tends to agree. “Products like this reinforce the idea that even our faces need ‘fixing’ to be acceptable, feeding into a relentless cycle of self-surveillance and perfectionism,” Ms Krawitz tells news.com.au. “For young people especially, it sends a harmful message that natural features aren’t enough, eroding self-worth and distorting what beauty really means. It’s not just about the product, it’s about the pressure it silently places on those watching.” No lasting change Seriously – is there a single woman on this planet who ever thought, ‘You know what my life is missing? Spanx for my face.’ Cosmetic experts have even said that a tight garment like this will likely only give you a few seconds of a slimmer face, due to reduced puffiness and swelling. But ultimately, things will just revert to how they were before. So while you might look more snatched in a mirror selfie, I worry about what this might do to your lasting confidence. Will you think that you’re not as beautiful without it? Will this become a gateway product making you want to get surgery? But could this somehow be empowering? If you think I’m being dramatic, I get it. I can already hear you typing through the screen: “Let women do what they want!” And I’m a big supporter of that sentiment. I really am. But with this, I fear it’s not really what women want. It’s what they’ve been told they should want. And it’s outdated. The history of facial straps and bandages goes back centuries, most recently in the early 1900s, when beauty salons advertised chin straps to ‘lift’ sagging skin and get rid of double chins. It’s the same concept now, just packaged differently, with Skims giving it a chic twist and adding an Instagram-worthy filter. In 2025, this is just the latest version of a long tradition that tells women they need to compress themselves, look thinner and appear younger. And in a world where it’s normalised to talk about weight loss injections, buccal fat removal, and face taping, it’s easy to feel angry about Skims’ latest release, which seems perfectly timed. Can Kardashian stop trying to cash in on this skinny-obsessed climate and leave our jaws, and faces alone? Our Apps"

    "content": "A furore over a popular outdoor gym at Bondi Beach has led to a very ugly reaction. A social media storm over a cult outdoor gym at Bondi Beach has led to a barrage of ugly threats against Waverley Mayor Will Nemesh. Rangers temporarily removed free weights from Bondi Park Fitness Station in March after Waverley Council received public safety complaints. In July, free weights returned to the gym after council passed a resolution allowing them, with safety measures in place. But media reports suggested weights had been removed because the gym was attracting “too much testosterone” — a claim that the council has rubbished. Fitness trainer Vix Erber described the gym as a male-dominated area. “It’s really just a bro area and full of testosterone and that’s why so many women train in gyms instead – unless you wanted to pick up a bloke, it’s not a space you’d ever consider using,” Ms Erber told The Sydney Morning Herald. A furore then erupted online with Mr Nemesh as the target. News.com.au understands gym users were concerned the council was cracking down on testosterone and men. A council spokesman said the upset on social media was sparked by “false and misleading information”. “Threats have been received by Mayor Will Nemesh, and while non-local trolls appear to be responsible, Council takes the content seriously and has referred it to authorities,” the spokesman said. “Waverley Council has a zero-tolerance policy towards violent or threatening conduct directed at its staff, volunteers and elected officials.” The spokesman reassured gym users that “free weights continue to be available at Waverley Council’s outdoor gym at Bondi Beach”. “Some equipment brought to the space by members of the community was temporarily removed after public safety concerns were flagged, but council worked with all parties to find a balanced and fair solution.” A man has died and another six people are in hospital in a deadly disease outbreak in inner Sydney. A rare side effect from COVID-19 vaccines has caught the attention of health experts, after a number of people reported unusual symptoms.

    "content": "Australia Post faces mounting criticism after a resident's desperate attempt to receive their parcel exposes widespread delivery failures. An Aussie’s struggle to get their parcel delivered by Australia Post has gone viral, with many people sharing their own delivery horror stories. The user from Hermit Park in Townsville, posting on the r/AustraliaPost Reddit forum, shared how they wrote a note to their postie to ensure a pair of headphones they ordered were delivered successfully. The handwritten letter, stuck to the outside wall of their door, read: “Good morning Au Post! Please knock as I’m studying upstairs and am deaf in one ear. Thank you so much! :)” They also mentioned in the post’s caption that they had left their front door and windows open, were home all day, didn’t have headphones on, and kept checking the Australia Post app. Despite all this, their order still wasn’t delivered. Instead, they received a notification saying, “We couldn’t deliver your parcel, so we’ve taken it to HERMIT PARK LPO for collection,” with tracking confirming the item now awaited pick-up at a local post office. “Proof that sometimes they’re too lazy to knock or even try to contact you. Fuming as I can’t pick it up till Thursday,” the person concluded. An Australia Post spokesperson told news.com.au, “We are keen to look into this matter further and encourage the customer to get in touch with us directly via our website or by calling”. Australia Post drivers, who are often contractors, are required to knock three times, wait 30 seconds, and take a photo of the front door or intercom if they can’t deliver a parcel. These photos are available to customers via the Australia Post app or through their customer service team. The post resonated with plenty of others, who shared their empathy and own experiences. One said: “I got the ‘Sorry your parcel could not be delivered due to not being able to get past stuff in the driveway’ … But they walked past everything to put the parcel slip with a note on it exactly where the parcels get put”. Another commented: “I get the excuse ‘no safe location’ when the safe location is my front door which is completely obscured from the street, and can’t see anything there – where they left the card”. A third shared: “Every single time I order a parcel I stand on the balcony of my third-story flat and watch the Aus Post van pull into the driveway, put a notice in my mailbox and immediately drive off – drives me crazy!” Another claimed: “They deliberately avoid delivery because it is quicker to just dump every delivery and the local post office”. However, not everyone had negative stories. One person said: “I had a postie once who would bang on the door and scream at the top of his lungs, ‘AUSTRALIA POST’ even if I’m looking directly at him through the window near the door. God I miss that man”. Another joked: “My postie knocks on my door like he has a warrant, I start hiding stuff around the house (that’s not even illegal) then I realise it’s just Australia Post”. It comes after a driver for Australia Post was sacked last week after being caught on CCTV faking a parcel drop-off. The footage, also shared on Reddit, shows an Australia Post van arrive at a property and park outside the driveway gates. According to the footage captured on the resident’s Google Nest security camera, the driver sits inside the vehicle for a few minutes. He then gets out, walks through the gates without the parcel, takes a photo, and drives off. An Australia Post spokesperson confirmed the driver was sacked following the incident. “Australia Post has strict protocols for parcel delivery,” they said. “These actions clearly do not align with the standards we expect, and this driver is no longer delivering for Australia Post”. An Aussie artist who lives in the United States has revealed a hilarious cultural difference — and many Aussies don’t even realise it’s “weird”.

    "content": "Just days after drawing huge crowds at 4am, an American chain that opened in Sydney has introduced strict rules amid Aussie’s complaints. Just days after people lined up at 4am for the opening of a cult US chain in Australia, customers have been slapped with a buying limit, as the restaurant struggles to keep up with demand. Auntie Anne’s, the world’s largest hand-rolled soft pretzel franchise, made its debut Down Under with the opening of its first store at Westfield Parramatta on Saturday. But while some Australians lined up more than five hours before its doors opened to get their hands on the doughy treat, the store has been riddled with complications. During its first few days of trading, demand for the iconic Auntie Anne’s pretzels has been so overwhelming, customers can now only buy 3 at a time. Meanwhile some of those who have been lucky enough to get their chops around the bread-like product have complained that it was “burnt” and “didn’t taste great”. Yu-Jin Lee, who along with his business partner Johann Wong has worked with Auntie Anne’s to bring the chain to Australia, told news.com.au the store had been inundated with customers and as such has had to take measures to make sure no one is disappointed. “Each of our pretzels is carefully hand-rolled and baked in small batches by our new kitchen team, who are doing their best to deliver a great experience,” he said. “As with any handmade process, small variations can occur and with such high demand, every day offers valuable opportunities for our team to grow and finetune their skills. “To help more people get a taste, we’ve temporarily set a limit of three pretzels per customer.” He also apologised to anyone who purchased a pretzel that felt it “didn’t meet expectations” and urged them to “reach out to us directly”. “We truly appreciate feedback and would love the opportunity to make it right,” he said. “We’re incredibly grateful for the enthusiastic welcome we’ve received since opening Auntie Anne’s in Sydney and send a heartfelt thank you to everyone who’s lined up patiently to enjoy our freshly baked pretzels during this exciting launch week.” Social media has exploded with videos on the cult chain’s recent Sydney opening, though mostly positive, there were some who pointed out there appeared to be “teething problems” in Parramatta. “They opened late, there were certain items on the menu that are ‘not available’ at the moment which was really disappointing. The pretzels were OK, the sticks were the best out of all of them, I’d give them a 5 out of 10 at the moment until they sort some things out,” one disgruntled customer shared on TikTok. “Have waited 90 minutes in line to find out there’s no pretzel bites, despite the fact it’s on the menu and on the shop front, they just weren’t selling them today,” whinged another. While another claimed she waited 2 hours only to be sold “burnt” pretzels. Auntie Anne’s has since responded to the video, stating “we’re still in our early days, but that’s no excuse. If you’re open to giving us another chance, we’d love to twist your day with some fresh pretzels on us”. Popular Melbourne food bloggers @nectoriouspapi and @DubEatsEverything defended the chain’s new venture, calling for Aussies to “cut them some slack”. “It’s hard when you first open and have massive lines, what are you meant to do?” DubEatsEverything told news.com.au. “They only have a very small oven … and at $5 for a pretzel, it’s pretty reasonably priced.” Nectorious Papi agreed, stating: “People need to cut them some slack as the demand is higher than they predicted. It’s expected when something new that has never been in Australia before opens.” Mostly though, people were delighted with their pretzels, which cost between $5.80 and $6.50 dependent on which flavour purchased. Lines filled Westfield Parramatta’s top floor on Saturday as hungry Aussies waited hours in order to get their hands on Original, Cinnamon, Sweet Almond and Pepperoni flavoured pretzels. One social media user even claimed that the queue wrapped all the way around to the train station outside. Despite the overwhelming demand, more than 1000 pretzels were sold on opening day, and the new bakery has continued to draw large crowds since. The owners of a rapidly growing fast food chain have responded to customer concerns after an outbreak at one of its locations. Coles and Woolies staffers are exposing the bizarre things they’ve found at work, labelling shoppers who do it “grubs”. Are you guilty?

    "content": "Coles and Woolies staffers are exposing the bizarre things they’ve found at work, labelling shoppers who do it “grubs”. Are you guilty? Shoppers are exposing the bizarre things they’ve found at supermarkets, including the bones of an entirely devoured roast chicken. A picture recently shared on social media showed a bag of Coles Roast Chicken discovered at the Southland, Victoria, store. However, instead of the bag being filled with a chicken, all it contained was the ravaged carcass left behind by a seemingly hungry customer. “A customer ate a whole rotisserie chicken in the store and left a bag full of bones in the tissue aisle,” a Reddit user, who claimed to work at the supermarket giant, said. For the best lifestyle coverage in Australia - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. Some social media users found the act of eating a whole chicken hilarious — and were impressed that someone was able to get away with such a blatant act of theft. “Gotta commend them for not only their commitment but discretion. I mean how does one eat an ENTIRE chicken without getting caught? Either they’ve done this enough to know how to be discrete or they huffed that thing,” one person commented. Another said; “Put it in the basket and walk up and down each aisle. You realise pretty quickly the general public doesn’t care about you lol.” “Well it’s acceptable to eat a few grapes why can’t someone check the chicken is not well prepared? Lucky it wasn’t the hound ‘Think I’ll take two chickens’,” one commented. One added: “Honestly I’m impressed. The tissue aisle was probably a tactical move tbh.” “Won’t be hard to spot on the CCTV but damn that’s effort eating the whole damn chicken,” another social media user added. One added: “Probably some gym bro.” “You know what if I saw this at work, I wouldn’t even be mad. This is impressive and funny while not leaving a huge mess to clean up,” another said. One commented: “I reckon most people would be surprised by how often this happens.” “They probably didn’t eat it they probably shredded it up and put it in a different bag or hid it inside something so they didn’t have to pay for it,” one commented. One social media user called it “grub behaviour” but others gave the customer the benefit of the doubt, saying it was likely an act of desperation. “Yeah, if it was a homeless or hungry poor person, I’m glad they ate it,” one said. Another added: “Tbh, in this economy, I can kinda respect it.” “If someone is doing it that rough they need to do this to get a nice chicken dinner, and not even be able to sit and enjoy it, they need it more that I do,” one commented. One said: “Must have been starving, they inhaled it. My friends work at Coles and Woolworths and see homeless people come in and eat but also purchase a drink or something and I get it you gotta eat.” It’s not unusual to find something slightly off at a retail store. Workers around the world have reported finding everything from open chip packets gorged on while strolling the aisles, used nappies and even urine in vases. Internet personality Emily Solberg found a stash of KFC’s Popcorn Chicken hidden inside a gumboot at Walmart in January. Meanwhile in 2022, a Woolworths Coffs Harbour worker found a half eaten kebab hidden on the shelves. The worker labelled it a “pig” act and said working in the team that restocked shelves at night, sights like this weren’t uncommon. Another picture showed a corn relish dip shoved into a box of Chicken Crimpy Shapes. Last year, during the peak of the egg shortage, Australians were doing their best to secure a perfect carton. So, they would dump broken eggs onto the shelf. The Pick and Mix section of supermarkets have always proved controversial with a pigeon being spotted at a Coles store earlier this year. Last year, a customer called out another shopper for simply sticking their hand in and taking a snack for the road.

    "content": "A Queensland mother has warned fellow parents after her child made a chilling discovery inside a play structure at a popular play centre. A Queensland mother has warned fellow parents after claiming her children found a butcher’s knife hidden inside a play structure at a popular Gold Coast play centre. Tiani Palmer described the moment her family’s celebration turned into a nightmare. “On the 6th of July 2025, we celebrated my daughter’s 4th birthday at Bella’s Wonderland in Southport. What was supposed to be a magical day quickly turned into something deeply disturbing and dangerous,” she wrote on Facebook. According to Palmer, her six-year-old son and two other boys of the same age were playing in the main playground area when they stumbled upon the large knife hidden inside the equipment. “While playing in the main playground area, my 6-year-old son and two other 6-year-old boys found a large butcher’s knife hidden down the side of the mats inside the play structure. A KNIFE. In a children’s playground.” Palmer said she immediately handed the weapon to staff, who she claimed reacted with indifference. “I was in shock and incredibly concerned, not just for my own children but for every family that walks through those doors,” he said. Palmer said she attempted to contact the play centre’s management but was repeatedly stonewalled. “The next day, I called the centre multiple times, asking to speak with the manager. I was told she was ‘sick’ and would call me back when she could. I never heard from her. I even followed up with an email. Still nothing. “For the price you pay to host a birthday party at these types of places, you would think your child would be safe and it’s a safe environment. My daughter’s birthday could have ended in absolute tragedy.” “I’m beyond disappointed and honestly disgusted by how this situation was handled.” She has reported the incident to Queensland Police. However, a Queensland Police Service spokesperson told theGold Coast Bulletin the centre also lodged an online report to police. They have so far been unable to determine how the knife got there. “Officers spoke with management and staff, however it remains unknown who placed the knife at the location or when it was placed there,” the spokesperson said. “CCTV footage did not assist with identifying any offender. At this time, there are no further avenues of investigation.” Thaddeus was born from an embryo frozen before either of his parents even started school. A fed-up mum’s confrontation with her daughter’s alleged bullies has racked up half a million views, but some people think she crossed the line.

    "content": "X-rated noises have pushed one Sydney apartment resident to breaking point, but experts say there's a solution. A resident in a Sydney apartment says he’s fed up after enduring months of “consistent” loud music, instrument playing and X-rated noises coming from his neighbour’s flat beneath him. The man, who took to Reddit to vent, has asked for advice about how to deal with the situation, where he claims he and his partner are subjected to the loud noises between 11pm and 2am. “Yes, I know it’s apartments! You will get noise here and there, and for the most part, I can tolerate it … up until 10pm or so,” he wrote to the forum. He then shared a video he recorded that captured one of the “songs” his neighbour was singing recently. In the clip, a man is heard singing “F**k, f**k, f**k,” repeatedly to the sound of what appears to be a guitar background track. He believes the poster has recently gone through a breakup with his girlfriend. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, he attempted to approach the apartment multiple times around midnight on workdays to ask about the singing and instruments. “Usually (I got) no response or a ‘f**k off’ shouted from wherever he is,” he said. He also said another neighbour had tried a similar approach and even “banged on his door” with little success. The Redditor claimed this was a consistent issue, but only provided video evidence of this one occasion. Lawyer weighs in Strata lawyer, Amanda Farmer, told news.com.au that the resident should contact the strata manager (if there is one) or find out who the secretary of the strata committee is. “This noisy neighbour is potentially breaching the by-laws, and the committee can issue an official ‘notice to comply’,” Ms Farmer explained. “If the noisy resident is a tenant, the landlord should be informed of this behaviour as it’s likely also a breach of their lease.” Ultimately, she said either the suffering resident or the owners’ corporation can take the situation to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) and seek a penalty of up to $1000 and an order that the behaviour stop. Etiquette tips to deal with noisy neighbours Meanwhile, Jo Hayes, an etiquette expert, has shared her tips on how to deal with noisy neighbours, while acknowledging that the Reddit post is on the more extreme end of the spectrum. But when it comes to more common noise complaints, Ms Hayes says there are a few general rules of thumb to follow. “My starting point advice is to communicate the issue either by written letter or face-to-face,” she says. “Always keep in mind the conflict resolution MO: be kind, calm and clear.” If the situation appears like it could turn volatile, she warns against face-to-face confrontation and suggests approaching a third party to intervene. Commenters share their thoughts Commenters agreed it was an annoying situation to be in, but many couldn’t help but comment on the humorous nature of the song. “I’m so sorry, but this is hilarious. What a stunning break-up song,” one commenter wrote. “The funniest part is he is actually on rhythm,” said another, as someone else called the tune “a bop”. “Why did this have to come out after the hottest 100 of all time?” asked another. “Publish the song on Spotify, make millions, buy a new house,” suggested a different user. Jokes aside, many people did share their advice for the man and expressed their sympathies about the situation.

    "content": "Heartbreaking footage has emerged of another dog stuck on a balcony just weeks after a Melbourne corgi made headlines around the country. A group of Sydney neighbours are speaking out to draw the attention over the plight of a balcony-bound dog, capturing video of the small pet left outside at all hours as the city shivers through winter. In Wentworth Point, locals say they’ve been left “heartbroken” by the sight of a small dog seen alone on an exposed concrete balcony for prolonged periods, with no visible bedding, toys or kennel. Neighbours have been taking turns monitoring the dog in recent weeks, and footage they have captured shows the dog out on the balcony at various times of day and night, with the animal whimpering in one clip. Locals said the dog appeared to have been spending nights inside the apartment since one neighbour confronted the owner on the street this week, but they remain concerned. “We’re feeling much better about the intervention but it only occurred due to community pressure and action. As this situation with the dog being left out all night has been occurring for months and there was no previous change, I think it would be understandable that concerned community members would have reservations about repeated behaviour,” said one local on a community Facebook page. Speaking to news.com.au, local Shiv said residents “can no longer sit by and witness this”. “For weeks, we have observed the dog’s behaviour … from frequent barking to prolonged howling, to now barely making a sound and often lying curled up on the cold concrete,” she said. Residents claim the dog has been regularly seen scratching at the door and crying on the balcony of the luxury apartment complex, where rent costs upwards of $1500 a week. “We’ve taken every possible step to address the situation. We’ve attempted to make numerous reports with the RSPCA and have been in contact with the Animal Welfare League,” said Shiv. However, a spokesperson for the building’s management told news.com.au they were aware of concerns, and that they had co-operated with authorities. “We take animal welfare and community concerns seriously and are aware of a local Facebook post regarding a dog sighted on a balcony,” they said in a statement. “While we understand the community’s concerns, we wish to clarify that there is currently no evidence of cruelty or neglect involving the dog in question. We have responded transparently and cooperatively to inquiries from Animal Welfare NSW and remain committed to supporting any further investigations in line with legislative requirements. “Our on-site management team has conducted visual welfare checks, and the dog appeared to be in good condition when observed.” Management said it was “monitoring the situation closely” and would take further steps if required. Another neighbour, Lyndal, told news.com.au that she walks her dog around 5am, often hearing crying and whining from the apartment balcony, after the dog was left out at night. “I didn’t think too much of it at first, but as more people began to notice, it clicked to me that the dog must be there overnight,” she said. Lyndal said concerned locals began taking turns to check on the dog at different times of the night, and claimed the dog had been seen on the balcony at all hours of the night. “I haven’t witnessed one interaction between the owner and the dog. It just sits outside in the freezing cold,” she said. Tensions boiled over this week when a member of the community confronted the owner from the street below, a move that other residents have described as “unhelpful”. Since then, neighbours claim the dog has been moved inside. “It is deeply upsetting,” said Shiv. “We aren’t wanting to publicly shame the owners or have the dog forcibly removed from their care. Many of us have offered support such as kennels, bedding, dog walking, or pet sitting. But no one is taking us up on these offers. Unfortunately, these offers have been met with no response from the owners.” A spokesperson for the City of Parramatta Council told news.com.au: “With animal welfare matters of this nature, Council encourages concerned residents to contact building management or the appropriate animal welfare organisation such as the RSPCA.” RSPCA declined to comment but wrote in an email to news.com.au that, as a general proposition, they take every report of animal abuse seriously. NSW’s Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 states that “a person in charge of an animal shall not fail to provide the animal with food, drink or shelter, or any of them.” Individuals that breach this are subject to a maximum 150 penalty units or imprisonment for six months, or both. news.com.au attempted to contact the dog owner for comment. The incident comes after earlier this month a dog was filmed pacing up and down on a tiny, inner city balcony in Melbourne. A concerned neighbour filmed the dog over a period of months, sparking nationwide outrage over the heartbreaking scene. Harry the corgi, who was previously known as Trump, was surrendered by his owner to Melbourne city council after both parties agreed it was the right decision. Now, just weeks later, Harry has a new lease on life after being adopted by couple Aaron and Karen and their other corgi Maya. Australian flyers will soon be able to travel with their furry friends after regulators cleared a major hurdle blocking pets on planes. A dog groomer was caught abusing multiple dogs in shocking footage that went viral on Facebook and that led to her arrest.

    "content": "A long-time Wallaby has announced that he will walk away from Test rugby after Australia’s battle with the British and Irish Lions on Saturday night. Veteran Wallabies halfback Nic White says it’s the “right time” for him to retire from Test rugby. White, 35, has announced that Australia’s clash with the British and Irish Lions on Saturday night in Sydney, where he will start, will be his final Test. “There’s been great competition for the nine (halfback) jersey here in the Wallabies for a number of years, and it feels like the right time to pass on the baton with some more good young players coming through who will need time in the saddle leading into what’s going to be an unbelievable experience of a home Rugby World Cup in 2027,” White said. “Pulling on the gold jersey was a dream of mine when I was a young boy in Scone and to say I’ve done it 72 times, with one last crack on Saturday night, is something I’m incredibly proud of and a privilege I’ve never taken for granted. “Rugby has given me so much to be grateful for. I’ve made some incredible memories, some lifelong friendships and had the opportunity to see the world.” White came off the bench in Australia’s 21-18 win over Fiji in Newcastle on July 6 but was not part of the Wallabies’ 23-man squad for the opening two Tests of the series against Lions, with Jake Gordon the starting half in both of the home side’s losses and Tate McDermott being the back-up option among the reserves. McDermott has again been named on the bench for Saturday night’s clash, with Gordon missing out on the squad entirely. Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt denied White’s selection had been based on sentiment. “It’s a Test match and you pick people who are capable of playing that Test match and we believe that Nic is,” Schmidt said. “He’s team first all the time and has been at the top of the game for over a decade. “Having coached against `Whitey’, and now worked with him in the Wallabies environment, he’s the ultimate competitor. “I know how much pulling on the gold jersey means to him and on behalf of the current group we wish him and his family all the best for the next chapter.” In another backline change, winger Dylan Pietsch has replaced Harry Potter, who injured his hamstring in the Wallabies’ 29-26 loss to the Lions at the MCG last Saturday. In the forwards, prop Taniela Tupou and flanker Tom Hooper will start at the expense of injured pair Allan Alaalatoa (shoulder) and Rob Valetini (calf) respectively. There have also been changes to the bench, with prop Zane Nonggorr and versatile back Andrew Kellaway replacing Tom Robertson and Carlo Tizzano. Schmidt said his squad had “started to gather momentum” after Australia’s last-gasp defeat in Melbourne, where the Lions took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-Test series. “The squad was certainly deflated after the gut-wrenching end to last week’s Test in Melbourne, but … will be ready to go again on Saturday,” Schmidt said. White, who will retire from all rugby at the end of the year, will continue to train with Western Force ahead of the Super Rugby AUS competition starting in September. “I’ll keep working hard with the Western Force, who have been an incredible support for me and my family since we moved west nearly two years ago,” the former ACT Brumbies star said. “Hanging up the boots for good at the end of the year will also allow me to spend more time with my wife Mel and three boys Leo, Sonny and Vinnie, which is something I’m massively looking forward to.” Wallabies team to play Lions at Accor Stadium on Saturday at 7:45pm (AEST): 1.

    "content": "Tom Lynagh says he has been mindful not to ‘overplay his hand’ in his role as Australia’s flyhalf against the British and Irish Lions. Tom Lynagh admits he wasn’t expecting to be Australia’s starting flyhalf during the Wallabies’ series against the British and Irish Lions, but says it has been a “seamless transition” from being on the bench to wearing the No.10 jersey. The neck injury suffered by Noah Lolesio in the Wallabies’ 21-18 win over Fiji earlier this month opened the selection door for 22-year-old Lynagh, whose only previous experience for Australia had been three appearances off the bench. And while he hasn’t been able to guide his nation to victory in his two starts against the Lions, Lynagh said he “done all right”, but hadn’t been entirely pleased with his goal-kicking. He missed his only attempt on goal in Australia’s 27-19 first Test loss in Brisbane, and kicked four from six in the Lions’ series-clinching 29-26 win on last Saturday’s second Test in Melbourne. “I’m a bit disappointed in my goalkicking so far,” Lynagh said. “I feel like that’s let myself and the team down a bit, but in terms of the rest of it, it’s been good. “I’m just playing part of the system, and just trying to do my role for the team, and not overplay my hand.“I didn’t quite expect it, to be honest, but it has been great. The boys around me in the team have been great. “It felt like a seamless transition really. They’ve given me a lot of confidence and so has (coach) Joe (Schmidt).” Support for Lynagh has also come from his father, Wallabies great Michael Lynagh, who has flown to Australia from his England base to see his son in action. “Dad’s been out here, and I’ve seen him quite a few times, which has been really nice,” Tom said. Despite the three-Test series being out of Australia’s reach, Lynagh was confident the Wallabies could avoid being whitewashed by beating the Lions on Saturday night at Sydney’s Accor Stadium. “It would mean a lot for all of us, and everyone that has supported us throughout the series so far,” he said. “We put in a good performance last week (at the MCG), and hopefully we can try to do the same, and get the result in the end. “We know there are a lot of people supporting us, and a lot of people going out to the game, so we’d just like to try to give them something back.” The Wallabies have suffered another injury blow, with winger Harry Potter (hamstring) being joined by prop Allan Alaalatoa (shoulder) on the sidelines. Wallabies forward Jeremy Williams said Alaalatoa was a “massive part of the group”. “We just wish him the best in his recovery and hopefully he’ll be back out there soon,” Williams said. Those in contention to replace Alaalatoa in Australia’s starting line-up on Saturday night include Tom Robertson, Taniela Tupou and Zane Nonggorr. . To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Andrew Johns has weighed in on Kalyn Ponga’s uncertain future as the Newcastle Knights lurch from one disaster to another. COMMENT Decades in the rugby league wilderness have seen Knights fans acclimatise to spending the majority of their seasons crying in the bathtub. But for a club that lives with a gentle hum of peril in its ear even at the best of times, 2025 has been a season that has surpassed most by sinking beyond the gurgler and down in to the stink. Not only is Newcastle moored at the foot of the table with an attack backfiring on all cylinders, rumours are now circling that Kalyn Ponga’s mooted release to rugby and Adam O’Brien’s uncertain future as coach are both about to receive the dreaded full support of the board. FOX LEAGUE, available on Kayo Sports, is the only place to watch every game of every round in the 2025 NRL Telstra Premiership, LIVE with no ad-breaks during play. New to Kayo? Get your first month for just $1. Limited-time offer. Andrew Johns has given his blessing for Ponga to leave the Knights — either to join another NRL club, play rugby union or  to the breakaway R360 league — insisting he would say “thank you” to Ponga for his service. “I give him a big thank you for coming to the club and if he wants to move on, I say thank you for what you have done for the club,” Johns told the Freddie and the Eighth podcast. “He has carried the club. He signed after the three wooden spoons in a row and that year, the Cowboys got to a grand final. “Look, he got signed for big money but struggling clubs have to pay overs for a marquee player. “He has attracted players to the club, he has attracted sponsors, I would imagine his social media reach would be huge. “So I would say thank you to Kalyn for what you have delivered to the club. Thank you very much. If you want to move on, so be it. “No animosity whatsoever.” But with everyone rubbernecking at McDonald Jones Stadium as it burns, one factor has been conveniently lost like a red-headed middle child in a shopping mall. When Dylan Brown was announced in April as Newcastle’s new signing for 2026, the club couldn’t have dreamt of the impact his signing would immediately make. That’s because everything at Newcastle has gone so belly-up since he agreed to terms that the only explanation is he signed the deal in puppies blood with a dodo feather. Not only has the club gone in reverse on the paddock as it suffers a calamitous injury toll, it’s now about to swap out a marquee player for a new coach who’ll be walking in to a rats nest as his predecessor departs with a seven-figure payout. And while Brown has played no direct role in this cursed period for the Knights, never fear: he’ll have plenty of chances to personally contribute when he arrives. Not only is the Eels five-eighth about to hoover $1.3m a year from the club’s salary cap for an entire decade, he’s supposed to do so while playing in the foreign position of halfback. This would be fine if he wasn’t a robust running playmaker who deals more in muscle than minutiae, but he’s not — and that’s why signing him to play as a librarian is the cardboard straw of popular and practical decisions. “He is not a Nathan Cleary or a Mitchell Moses, who are dominant halfbacks that go pretty much everywhere and do all the kicking,” club legend Johns warned on WWOS’ Immortal Behaviour in April. “He’s not that dominant voice. He’s not a dominant halfback, it’s not Dylan’s nature.” Of greater concern, Brown was supposed to subsidise his logbook on the L-Plates playing alongside Ponga, but now he’ll either be busy in France or learning to scream “through the gate sir!” in Japanese. Add the fact the new arrival is playing for a coach he didn’t sign for in a team missing the generational talent he was promised, and you can already hear the decade of blame he’ll cop for going viral leaving a toilet cubicle and not being Gary Johns’ son. Even Brown himself thinks his deal is already a lemon, with the Kiwi international reportedly knocking back an offer to join the Knights early in favour of somewhere safer for his ego, like playing reserve grade in front of 35 people and an Otto bin. All in all, the new recruit shapes as the face of Newcastle’s next lap around its möbius strip of pain, a club that as rugby league’s Dot.com Boom peaked in the late 90s and burst in the early noughties. While inarguably an upgrade on the ghastly Nathan Brown years, O’Brien’s era will be remembered for making up the numbers in finals before switching his halves pairings so frequently that it became a game of three card monte where everybody won except Newcastle. A new coach will at least provide fans with a psychological band-aid before another decade of a salary cap weighed down by one reluctant saviour and a smattering of journeymen and mulleted locals. As for Ponga, it can only mean two things when rumours emerge of his interest in rugby: either the Knights are struggling, or it’s Tuesday again. The club might as well get his dalliance over and done with by allowing him to finally embark on the rugby league “gap year” he’s craved: A stint in French rugby, six games in Japan and then an unsurprising return with the Roosters. - Dane Eldridge is a warped cynic yearning for the glory days of rugby league, a time when the sponges were magic and the Mondays were mad.

    "content": "He has travelled the world boxing as an amateur, but rising star Callum Peters is turning heads on both sides of the world in a hot start to his professional career. He has travelled the world boxing as an amateur, but rising star Callum Peters (3-0) turned a few heads in Las Vegas two weeks ago. That’s when the 22-year-old Paris Olympian went toe-to-toe in sparring with highly regarded American super-middleweight Elijah Garcia. From South Australia, the charismatic Peters was in Sin City to watch Tim Tszyu and Manny Pacquiao, but more than held his own against the much more experienced Garcia. “He put it on him,” said one witness. “He towelled him up”. After one session, Garcia refused to do any more rounds with ‘50 Cal’. Which is a fair effort when you consider Peters only has three professional fights to his name, with a fourth, against rugged Kiwi Marcus Heywood (9-8-2), coming up on Wednesday night in Brisbane. While Peters was losing a controversial decision to eventual gold medallist Nurbek Oralbay in Paris last year, Garcia had just finished up a three fight run appearing on two Gervonta Davis undercards and one Canelo Alvarez blockbuster at venues including T-Mobile Arena and the MGM Grand. In his most recent bout, Garcia battled back from a knockdown to defeat one-time Tim Tszyu opponent Terrell Gausha by decision. Peters shrugged off the sparring showdown when asked about it in Vegas as he prepares for his second fight in five weeks. His main goal is to showcase his talents on another televised card on Wednesday. But the ironic thing is that those same talents – which include an abnormally high punch output, and some deft footwork courtesy of his now trademarked indoor football shoes – mean he hasn’t actually had the opportunity to display his skills. None of his three opponents to date have made it out of the first round. Callum Peters and his indoor football shoes up now. #ParoNavarropic.twitter.com/S6ijMLoGzH “Marcus looks like a hard boy, he’s fought some hard opponents and he’ll bring a good show,” he said. “He should make it past the first round. “Hopefully people get to see more of me. “I like to throw a lot of volume, there’s always punches going.” There were questions raised when Peters was spotted in Vegas just a week and a half before his fight with Heywood. But the amateur star is no stranger to disrupted fight prep. His first scheduled opponent in Cairns in June pulled out with Covid, and a Kiwi replacement was forced out just three days before the fight when he wasn’t allowed in the country. Another replacement was found just two days before the bout, with local Muay Thai fighter Luca Lanigan copping three heavy knockdowns before the referee mercifully waved it off. “I’ve just got back from Vegas, I’m prepped and I’m ready to go,” Peters said. “Watching Tim and Manny Pacquiao got me thinking it could be me one day fighting in front of all those people and showing everyone all the hard work I’ve been doing in the gym.” Peters has called out a who’s who of domestic fighters from middleweight to light-heavyweight, but after this week’s fight will turn his attention to the amateur world championships in September. Meanwhile, a win in Wednesday’s main event will propel Aussie-based Kiwi Floyd Masson (15-2) into world title contention. Masson takes on John Parker (11-1) – the younger brother of former heavyweight world champion Joseph Parker – and the 33-year-old year-old has his sights on the very elite of the cruiserweight division. And that could mean a potential domestic world title blockbuster. “Jai (Opetaia) is the best cruiserweight in the world,” Masson said. “At the end of the day, you’re here to fight the best and prove yourself against the best. “Those are the opportunities I’m chasing. “As a fighter, you back yourself against anyone, and I believe I can beat anyone. “We’re ready to chase down another world title.” Originally published as ‘Towelled him up’: Rising Aussie star Callum Peters looking for breakout performance after Vegas sparring stint To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "A live TV stunt has gone horribly wrong after a baseball star attempted a backflip but ended up a bloody mess. A Savannah Banana baseballer has quite literally fallen on his face on live TV. While some people can be dud interviews or stumble over their words, Robert Anthony Cruz, who goes by Coach RAC online and in games for Harlem Globetrotters-style baseball team, tried to kick off his interview with CNN’s News Central with a bang. UFC FIGHT NIGHT: Whittaker vs De Ridder | SUN 27 JULY 5AM AEST | Australian former middleweight champion Robert Whittaker returns to the UFC against rising star Reinier de Ridder with a dream of getting back into title contention. | Available via Kayo Just not a bang like this. As they cut to him, Cruz went to perform the backflip but got stuck halfway, falling hard on the ground. Anchor Kate Bolduan said: “Oh Jesus,” before the flip before the set went silent. Cruz himself, who’s microphone pack went flying, appeared to say: “Oh my god, that never happens.” While the camera cut back to the anchors, co-anchor John Berman said: “That, what you just saw there, is a brand-new twist on America’s favourite pastime.” A CNN spokesman confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that they were “glad he’s okay and taking it in such stride”. The Savannah Bananas are an exhibition baseball team that have taken social media by storm with videos of them dancing before pitches, emphasising showmanship, fan participation and fast games. Cruz, 26, who was formerly a prospect for the Washington Nationals, took to Instagram after the fact to share what really happened in the viral moment. After requiring stitches in both his lip and his chin, he posted on his Instagram stories that the world “has my full permission to laugh”. “I can’t not laugh every time I watch it too — that sound, it’s crazy,” he said. He also shared a DM from a young baseballer that said: “You’re still my hero”. In a later video, he explained where it all went wrong. “They say all press is good press, huh? Well, you’ve probably seen the video — your boy is bouncing around the internet like a beach ball at a Nickelback concert,” Cruz said. He explained he was asked by producers if he had any tricks up his sleeve and he promised to do a backflip. He’s no beginner either, having caught balls doing backflips in games for the Bananas. He said he’d been on very little sleep after running a baseball camp for kids and had only arrived in New York at 2am. “I have done tens of thousands of backflips in my life — I had zero reason to doubt my abilities,” Cruz said. “Anyway, I’m standing on the stage, I get the countdown, it’s time. I send the flip. Next thing I know, I am on the floor and I’m rattled. I was pretty confused, my mic pack fell out of my pocket, my shoe flew off of my foot. “I don’t even know how that happened.” Cruz said he felt bad for the anchors who were left speechless, and that he wanted to continue the interview … until he noticed the blood. Thinking back he believed it happened because there was a bright board behind him and he was looking for the ground. “I kinda just lost where I was in the air and wound up under-rotating, plus my feet slipped,” Cruz said. “Apart from my damaged pride, I didn’t sustain any serious injuries.” To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Josh Giddey is in a standoff with his NBA team over his mega payday that is shrinking before his eyes as contract negotiations drag on. Josh Giddey is still waiting to get his next NBA deal as the Chicago Bulls play hardball on a mega contract extension in an off-season standoff that continues to drag on. The Australian finished his fourth NBA season on a hot streak, racking up triple doubles for fun and scoring a halfcourt buzzerbeater against the LA Lakers to send his value skyrocketing heading into restricted free agency. Watch England vs India Test Series LIVE & EXCLUSIVE on Fox Cricket, available on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1. It was widely expected that Chicago would offer Giddey a contract extension worth $30 million (A$45 million) per season, but that is yet to happen as the Bulls appear hesitant to shell out that kind of money. A contract of that value would make Giddey one of Australia’s highest paid athletes, excluding LIV golfers Cam Smith and Marc Leishman. As it stands, it looks likely Giddey may accept Chicago’s qualifying offer of $11.1 million (A$17m) for the 2025-26 season and bet on himself to outperform that value so he can command a more lucrative deal when he hits unrestricted free agency next summer. Alternatively, the Bulls will come to the table with a deal of around four years, $90 million (A$136 million), which is significantly lower than what Giddey’s camp is asking for. Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf has been notoriously stingy when it comes to avoiding paying the luxury tax, and now Chicago’s front office is holding out on giving Giddey a mega payday.The Aussie has every right to feel hard done by at the moment, given Chicago previously paid Patrick Williams USD$90 million over five years, despite the draft bust showing very little promise during his NBA career so far. Giddey averaged 21.2 points, 10.7 rebounds and 9.3 assists in 19 games for the Bulls after NBA All-Star break while shooting 45.7 per cent from 3-point range. The standoff between Giddey and Chicago can be put down to the fact it is a very bad time to be a restricted free agent in the NBA this off-season, with very few teams having salary cap space. Giddey, Brooklyn’s Cam Thomas, Golden State’s Jonathan Kuminga and Philadelphia’s Quentin Grimes could have earned deals worth in excess of $100 million in most other off-seasons. 5 former 1st rd. picks have signed a Qualifying Offer since 2018.Their next contract outside of Miles Bridges has not been pretty:Alex Len: 2/8.5MNerlens Noel: 2/3.7MRodney Hood: 2/11.7MDenzel Valentine: 2/4.1MMiles Bridges: 3/75M But a lack of cap space around the league this year and the NBA’s restrictive new collective bargaining agreement is making teams wary of shelling out big contracts on players who aren’t superstars. YardBarker’s Nathan Shirberg said: “Essentially, the Bulls are negotiating against themselves, which incentivises them to not negotiate at all. As it stands, the Bulls should feel no pressure to give in.” A Bulls executive told Spotrac’s Keith Smith: “We want to get a deal done with Josh. He’s as important of a player as we have. We see him as a foundational player for us. I hope we can find a deal that makes sense for us and him and that we’ll be together for a long time.” ClutchPoints’ Brett Siegel wrote that “no progress” has been made between Giddey’s camp and the Bulls. “The two sides met at NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, where Giddey and his camp made it clear they want a contract similar to that of Jalen Suggs (5-year, $150 million) and Immanuel Quickley (5-year, $162 million) and have not come down from their $30 million annual average value asking price,” Siegel wrote. “The Bulls have not offered more than a four-year contract in the $20 million per year range.” The Athletic’s Law Murray described the situation as “free agency hell, where Giddey is keeping the Bulls from doing anything except repeat their 2024 trade where they send a former Laker defender to a No. 1 seed in exchange for a lottery pick”. “Last year, it was Giddey from Oklahoma City in exchange for now two-time NBA champion Alex Caruso. This year, the Bulls sent (Lonzo) Ball to the Cavaliers for (Isaac) Okoro.” Chicago’s ownership and executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas have come under fire for being content to stay in the NBA’s no-man’s land of not committing to a full rebuild. Bill Simmons said on his podcast he would rather have any other roster situation for the next five years than Chicago’s. The Bulls have featured in the NBA play-in tournament in the past three seasons. “I just don’t know what this team is,” Simmons said. “Where am I going in the next three years? I know I’m not going to be a bottom five team next year … it just seems bleak to me. “If I’m a Bulls fan, what I am excited about? My owners have already made it very clear to me we’re never really going to spend money. “They’ve done a sh*tty job with the (Michael) Jordan legacy. I just don’t know what this team is other than a team that’s going to go 40-42 every year.” Co-host Ryen Russillo added: “I think the Giddey trade will turn out to be a good trade for them.” NBA pundits have no doubt Giddey will turn up for pre-season training camp with the Bulls, but there are some concerns about whether the contract negotiations will have left a sour taste in his mouth. Bulls insider K.J. Johnson said: “The Bulls hold all the power. Giddey is almost certainly going to be back on a qualifying offer or a long term deal. “What I would be concerned about is what kind of mindset is Josh Giddey going to come into camp with after the negotiations dragging on that long and then him maybe not getting what he wanted. “You want him coming into camp with a good feeling, pleased with his deal. The fact that it dragged on, guys get over that if they sign a deal that ultimately pays him $90 million over four years. That’s a lot of money.” One cryptic quote Giddey shared on his Instagram story this week read: “What a privilege to outgrow things you used to settle for.” That just about sums up the contract standoff right now.

Police and security were forced to tackle a ‘prankster’ who invaded the track at the Tour de France, just moments before the stage’s conclusion. The Sun reports the end of stage 17 almost ended in calamity when a spectator leapt over the boardings with his bike and tried to ride across the finish line.

The man was wearing a Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale jersey. Images released of the incident show that the man managed to cross the finish line before he was tackled by a police offer and fell off his bike and to the ground. He was then quickly removed from the track in order to clear a pathway for the fast-approaching leaders who were due to follow soon after. It’s not the first time that there have been issues on the track at this year’s Tour either. Security had to leap in front of a pro-Palestine protester who had made their way onto the track during stage 11 of the race. The track-invader sprinted down the racecourse with his hands in the air just 25 metres from the finish line of the stage last Wednesday, with riders cycling past as it happened. The protester was wearing a t-shirt that read: “Israel out of the Tour.” He also held a keffiyeh, a black-and-white checkered headdress and pro-Palestine symbol. The individual was tackled, thrust against the boardings and hauled off the road by security. Other fan incidents at this year’s Tour de France have included an Ineos team car hitting into a spectator that stepped onto the road during the 14th stage of the race. Fortunately Thursday’s incident didn’t cause any crashes. However, pouring rain in the final 30km of the 60.4km stage from Bollene to Valence did cause a crash of its own. With just 1km left to go a mass crash took out Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay, opening the door for Jonathan Milan to claim his second stage victory of this year’s Tour. Speaking after the win, Milan said: “This is a really fantastic team victory and I have to thank them from the bottom of my heart. “I survived with the help of my teammates. Without this, I would not be here. They delivered me in the best position (for the finish).” Aussie wins mountain stage from Pogacar On Friday morning (AEST) Australia’s Ben O’Connor won stage 18 of the Tour de France with a world class climb in the mountains. O’Connor, 29, took off alone 15km from the finish and navigated the mountain mist to win 1min 45sec ahead of Pogacar atop the Col de la Loze. The stage victory was an emotional one for the Aussie, who coming into the race had aspirations of fighting for the general classification. However, those goals were quickly dashed after a stage 1 crash which he said left him “pretty banged up”. “It’s a pretty cruel race,” O’Connor said to reporters.

    "content": "While Craig Bellamy remains undecided about who should play halfback with Jahrome Hughes out injured, the Storm coach is set to make a major switch. Storm coach Craig Bellamy concedes Nick Meaney will likely replace Ryan Papenhuyzen as the club’s first-choice goalkicker next week after the star fullback had an uncharacteristically off night from the tee in Thursday’s win over the Eels. Papenhuyzen was in his first game back after missing four matches with a calf injury and missed three of his four shots at goals in the 16-10 victory, including a conversion attempt from next to the posts that hit both uprights. He also missed a pair of penalty goals at crucial times in the tight contest, with Meaney replacing him at the end and nailing a tricky conversion from out wide to put the Storm up by six points. Papenhuyzen has kicked at about 80 per cent throughout his career and had only missed 11 shots at goal this season before Thursday’s match. “I think we’ll go back to Nick next week, to be quite honest,” Bellamy said, with Meaney doing plenty of the kicking in recent years. “We’ll have a chat about it and go from there.” Papenhuyzen had some nice touches in his return but also came up with a couple of errors. “It was always going to be a little difficult,” his coach said. “Paps hasn’t played for four weeks, so he was getting that combination back when we’ve had GA (Grant Anderson) playing in the centres and Nick Meaney has been playing fullback. “When you take all that into consideration, it was a pretty brave performance from us, but we were just a bit undisciplined at times.” The win moves the Storm into second spot, but they’ll need their attack to flow more smoothly if they are to seal a home final in the first week of the playoffs. Cameron Munster set up two tries with kicks, while Tyran Wishart had some threatening runs but didn’t bring the creativity that we usually see from Hughes. It’s why Bellamy could start Jonah Pezet at halfback against the Broncos next week, with the young star coming off the bench on Thursday and his future beyond 2025 now clouded given Hughes has re-signed. “He could (start) but I thought ‘Wish’ (Wishart) did a really good job tonight,” Bellamy said. “We will just use him how we see fit and what we think is best for the team. He mightn’t be in our 17 for a week or two, who knows. We’re just going to pick who we think is the best 17 this weekend against whatever opposition. “We just wanted to put him on the bench and have some back-up there.” While the Eels didn’t win, coach Jason Ryles can see plenty of improvement from a team that conceded 56 points when they played in Melbourne in round 1. They beat the Broncos away from home last week and their roster is starting to take shape as the Ryles revolution continues. “We know how much we’ve improved as individuals and as a team, and I think that was more proof,” he said. “The fight and the effort in the group at the moment are outstanding. Not for a second are they happy that we’ve been beaten and neither am I. “But at the same time, the improvement we’ve been showing week on week is there. “I honestly think we lost that game tonight, they didn’t beat us. That’s a really good thing for us going forward.” Lachlan Galvin’s first game against the Wests Tigers is the biggest story this week, but Benji Marshall couldn’t care less amid fears fans will give it to the young playmaker. The Daly Cherry-Evans contract mystery could drag on for at least another month as he leads Manly in a crucial clash against the team everyone assumes he’ll join next year.

    "content": "NRL star Adam Reynolds has lifted the lid on how former coach Wayne Bennett played the role of saviour for his marriage. Broncos star Adam Reynolds has opened up on how Wayne Bennett “saved” his marriage and why the messy exit from the Rabbitohs which left him feeling “ticked off”. This Friday night, Reynolds will face his former side and former coach in Bennett when Brisbane hosts Souths at Suncorp Stadium.

Get your first month for just $1. Limited-time offer > In a wide-ranging interview on the Inside Ball podcast, co-hosted by another former coach of Reynolds’ in Kevin Walters, the veteran halfback revealed that in 2020, Bennett was key in saving his marriage with wife Tallara. Reynolds said his relationship with Tallara was rocky, until he turned to Bennett who was his club coach at Souths at the time. “It was a really tough part of my life,” Reynolds said. “One thing I have been good at is parking my emotions to the side and focusing on what I need to at the time. “If I didn’t have that guidance from Wayne I don’t know where I’d be. He saved it (his marriage).” Reynolds’ story is just another example of the massive impact Bennett has had on professional rugby league players over the past three decades. While considered one of the greatest coaches ever, Bennett’s ability to connect with his players is unrivalled. “He’s very good at reading the room and I probably wasn’t giving out too much and he dragged me aside one day and checked in on me,” Reynolds said. “I opened up to Wayne because he gets the trust of the person and he gave me guidance and regularly checked in to see what’s going on.” Reynolds and Bennett both left the Rabbitohs in 2021. Bennett departed to help start up the incoming Dolphins while Reynolds was swept off his feet by the Broncos, signing a three-year deal from 2022. Even though Reynolds says he couldn’t be happier in Brisbane, four years ago, he thought he’d finish up a one-club man. Souths was the team he supported growing up and had spent ten seasons at, winning a grand final in 2014. He wanted to stay, but the Rabbitohs weren’t willing to come to the party. “It was frustrating through that time because all you want to do is stay at the club and finish your career there,” Reynolds said about his 2021 contract negotiations with Souths. “We got to the negotiating table and they offered half the money that I was on the previous year. They tossed up a one-year offer and I wanted two years … we couldn’t get to an agreement there. “Things sort of started getting leaked in the media that I couldn’t train, my body wasn’t well, this and that. “Whether it was them (Souths) or not, I don’t know but it sort of ticked me off a bit.” Cronulla were the favourites to land Reynolds before the Broncos swooped in with a touching gesture. “Dave (Donaghy – Broncos CEO) and Kev (Walters) flew down, came to my house and presented me with this jersey,” Reynolds said. “I remember looking at it and thinking how much I admired the Broncos and Allan Langer from afar. “It was nice that they felt they could trust me to go and do the job for them and their organisation and that jersey moment was a good little touch that won me over.” Originally published as How Bennett ‘saved’ Reynolds’ marriage — and what ‘ticked off’ star in messy Souths exit To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "St Kilda’s emphatic win over Melbourne has not distracted coach Ross Lyon from his side’s 15-week stretch of patchy form. The historic final quarter against Melbourne has “not seduced” St Kilda coach Ross Lyon away from his side’s distance from the competition’s best teams. The Saints mowed down a record margin to run over the top of the Demons last Sunday, kicking two goals in the final 10 seconds to pinch four points. St Kilda will give its fans another taste of it by playing the final quarter on the big screen ahead of this weekend’s match against North Melbourne. But Lyon, perhaps due to St Kilda’s three wins from 15 starts, is not basking in the emphatic finish. He wants club supporters to “indulge” in the victory but trusts his players have put it aside. “I think our fans and members should indulge but I think our players, we’ve just got to be hard-nosed pros, which we are,” he said. “There’s certainly no complacency from me and we as coaches, we know that and our young players (do too). “We’ve got a mindset of we’ve got to catch, we’ve got a bit of catching up to do yet.” The Saints played captivating and free-flowing footy in the final 30 minutes – a brand that would bode well in four winnable games on the run home. Lyon says he would like to see that run and dare more often but is under no illusions of how difficult it is to achieve consistently. “It really didn’t come to fruition until late,” he said. “There’s a whole mix, but clearly the ability to keep our spirit and connection going even when the scoreboard was against us was the most pleasing part. “Everyone wants to see the best version of themselves more consistently, but as we see when you look around, they’re not robots, they’re not machines, they’re humans. “It’s a grind, it’s hard, it’s long and you’re coming up against fierce opponents and mindsets. Sometimes they get on top, sometimes you get on top. “It’s not an exact science, there’s a bit of art form in it – to answer in simple terms, would we like to have those quarters more often?

    "content": "Gasps were heard after five professional hockey players learned their fate in court after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman. Five Canadian professional hockey players accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2018 were found not guilty on Thursday, with the judge ruling the complainant’s account of the alleged offences was not credible. The case had captured the country’s attention, and raised concern about broader issues in the culture of hockey, Canada’s cherished national sport. Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart and Callan Foote stood trial on charges they assaulted the woman in a hotel room in London, Ontario in Canada following a national men’s junior team celebration. All denied wrongdoing, claiming the woman — whose identity is protected — was an active and willing participant in a series of sex acts. Roughly 100 protesters supporting the woman were outside the court when the day began but were gone when court adjourned. The complainant’s lawyer, Karen Bellehumeur, called the verdict “devastating.” Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia read out her detailed decision in front of a packed London court, following one of the most closely watched trials in recent Canadian history. She opened the hearing by declaring that she did “not find the evidence of (the complainant) to be either credible or reliable,” and that prosecutors had failed to prove their case. Those declarations prompted gasps in the courtroom and embraces among the families of the accused, public broadcaster CBC reported. Some five hours later, Carroccia announced not guilty verdicts for each of the defendants. “I find as a fact that the complainant did express that she wanted to engage in sexual activity with the men,” she said. She ruled there was insufficient evidence to determine the consent expressed by the complainant “was vitiated by fear.” Criminal trials in Canada are often decided by a jury, but the case shifted to a judge-only trial after two juries were dismissed. Multiple investigations The complainant, 20 at the time, met McLeod at a bar in London before having sex with him. That initial encounter was not at issue in the trial, which focused on events that occurred after McLeod messaged a team-wide group chat asking if anyone was interested in a “three-way.” The court heard the woman engaged in multiple sex acts with the players over a number of hours. Prosecutors argued the players failed to take steps to ensure her consent. Defence lawyers said the woman willingly participated and only made the assault allegations after regretting her choices. In her reasoning for the verdict, the judge said there were “troubling aspects” to how the complainant recalled the events. Carroccia noted the woman said she was speaking “her truth,” not the truth, “which seemingly blurs the line between what she believes to be true and what is objectively true.” Bellehumeur said her client faced “insulting, unfair, mocking and disrespectful” treatment from the defence over several days of withering cross-examination. An initial police investigation into the allegations produced no charges. Subsequent media probes revealed Hockey Canada, a governing body, used funds from subscription fees paid by ordinary families for a $3.55 million CAD (A$3.95) out-of-court settlement with the woman, forcing the resignation of Hockey Canada’s leadership. Amid public uproar, London police re-opened the case and brought charges against the players last year. Formenton’s lawyer, Daniel Brown, told reporters after the verdict that London police “got it right seven years ago.” “Political and media pressure brought this allegation back into the spotlight,” Brown said, accusing prosecutors of “forging ahead with a hopeless prosecution.” Court proceedings focused on the evolving legal definitions of consent, and the trial addressed videos made by McLeod of the complainant saying she was OK with what happened. Prosecutors argued the decision to make a video indicated concern the sex was not consensual. Hart, a former National Hockey League goaltender, testified such videos were common practice among professional athletes. Carroccia made clear she did not assess the videos as evidence of consent, but found they shed light on the woman’s state of mind. “She was speaking normally. She was smiling. She did not appear to be upset or in distress,” the judge said. US President Donald Trump has taken an eye-opening threat to new heights as he doubled down on his stance for a major change. A young couple have been caught engaging in an apparent sex act during a sporting contest, much to the distress of fellow fans. WARNING: Explicit content.

    "content": "An former Wallabies star is trying a new sport that has him set to make his Olympic debut at age 40 in American prime time. Quade Cooper will be 40 years old by the time the 2028 Olympic Games come around, but he is hoping to make history in Los Angeles. The 75-cap Wallabies playmaker has played for the Kintetsu Liners in Japan for several years, but he’s unsure if he’ll return for another season of rugby union as he shifts his focus to his new passion, flag football. Cooper, 37, first caught the eye with a one-handed overhead pass during a rugby game in Japan and has gone viral on social media for his impressive trick passes. Tszyu vs Fundora 2 & Pacquiao vs Barrios | SUN 20 JULY 10AM AEST | Tim Tszyu faces Sebastian Fundora in a blockbuster rematch, plus Manny Pacquiao makes his highly anticipated return to the ring to face Mario Barrios. | Order now with Main Event on Kayo Sports “There was a game in Japan I played in two years ago, I actually threw one in a live game, just it was off the cuff, Cooper told news.com.au, speaking in his capacity as an investor in Aussie electrolyte brand HYRO. “It definitely wasn’t planned. I wanted to kick it across the field and someone was going to charge me down so I just threw it.” Cooper said Flag Football Australia got in touch with him after seeing his passing skills and brought up the prospect of playing in the Olympics as quarterback. “Those conversations just continued to grow and when I decided to finish up with my team in Japan, I was coming back here on holiday. “I haven’t fully closed the door on Japan yet but I was going back in my off-season break and there was a tournament over in LA. “So I jumped in on that and went over there, and I had so much fun. So it’s really swaying me to look at doing that full-time. “This sport is literally just grabbing the most fun parts of playing in the backyard and putting it onto a professional field.” He’s just returned from his first games with Australia’s Flag Football program in LA, which he said was “super fun” but he is still getting used to the game. “One of the hardest aspects of is there’s no contact, it’s just seems like you’re playing backyard footy having a bit of fun,” Cooper said. “When you’re playing rugby league or union, you never have to try and get yourself up for the contest because it’s a physical, combative collision sport, so if you’re not up for it you’re going to get hurt. “There’s a rule (in flag football) that the rusher can’t even touch the quarterback. If he hits you and makes contact, it’s a penalty. “There’s a lot of detail in rugby and rugby league but this to me was just on another level. It was about how many steps you’re taking before you have a cut. The detail is what I love about it. “One of the biggest drivers of me playing flag was being able to play quarterback, do this thing that was super fun, but also learn something new.” The LA 2028 Olympics will see five new sports added to the program — baseball/softball, lacrosse, squad and flag football, which is set to make a prime time debut. This week the schedule for the 2028 Games was released, with flag football taking centre stage in the first week of competition. Organisers have also parted with tradition and shifted swimming to the second week, moving athletics to the opening week of competition. Cooper had been set to represent Australia at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rugby Sevens, only to be denied that chance when his citizenship application was knocked back. He finally became an Australian citizen in 2022 and he is now turning his attention to flag football, hoping the non-contact nature of the sport allows him to play until he’s 40. “The Olympics is just the pinnacle of sport, so this would be amazing to be able to go there and do and compete for Australia, represent Australia in a new sport,” Cooper said. “Being a part of the Olympics and the possibility of having a medal is something that I just think will be super special.” Cooper jokes he’s “still a spring chicken, being able to play the game until I’m 37”, but added “not taking hits” was a big motivator for him taking up flag football. Shirtless photos of Cooper at training for flag football show a man who is still at the top of his game as a professional athlete. “I’m 37 so I still feel in great shape in the sense of I’m fit, strong and can still play the game, but another three years of getting hit, that’s a tough ask,” he said. “While you’ve still got the fire, do it as long as you can. I still have that competitive fire, but I’m not too sure I want to continue getting hit until I’m 39.” What is flag football? A combination of gridiron and Oztag, flag football is a non-contact sport where the aim is to advance up the field and score a touchdown in the opposition’s end zone. ‘Tackles’ are made by removing one of two vinyl ‘flags’ attached to the ball-carrier’s waist - one on each side. Each team, comprised of five players, has four attempts, known as downs, to reach the halfway line. If unsuccessful, the ball is turned over to the opposition, who start on their own five-yard line. Cooper has noticed flag football growing rapidly in popularity in children, particularly with parents increasingly conscious of concussion concerns from contact sport. “The exciting thing about it is that there’s always people looking for sports that are similar to rugby, similar to league, without the contact,” he said. “This opens up an avenue for parents to be able to allow their kids, both boys and girls, to do something without the threat of concussions, broken necks, multiple surgeries and whatnot. “It does open another avenue for everybody here in Australia.” Cooper and NRL star Daly Cherry-Evans are both investors in electrolyte hydration brand HYRO, and while DCE says he’s taking it one year at a time, it’s no secret the veterans care about what goes into their body. Cooper said: “Water is great but like it’s just not enough, it’s just the bare minimum. Adding electrolytes, it’s a must. ”You go across all footy teams, all elite sport, everybody’s using electrolytes. “Longevity, and being able to stay in the game for a long time, you’ve got to evolve and learn got to learn. Put better things in my body from what I eat, how I lift weights, to having a routine and how I wake up every day. “All those things add in and hydration is a massive, massive part of that.” Cherry-Evans is leaving Manly at season’s end but he remains tight lipped on where his future lies in the NRL, with all signs pointing to the veteran half joining Roosters. “No update there,” Cherry-Evans told news.com.au when asked about his future. “I’m just going to keep taking my time and make sure I make the right decision for myself and my family. “But (I’ve) definitely still got a fire burning. That’s always the most important thing, is you’ve got love for the game and a desire to keep competing. “My focus right now is where it needs to be, and that’s for the Manly side this year. “We’re sitting around that top eight at the moment, which is great. There’s definitely lots of improvement left in us for the back end of the year. “So if we can focus in and keep playing consistent footy, which we’ve done the last month, be able to play finals footy again, which is a big driving force for the team and I.” To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "After Oscar Piastri’s victory at the Belgian GP, a Formula 1 veteran has dropped his verdict for the fierce world title showdown. F1 commentator Martin Brundle has belatedly praised Oscar Piastri for his latest Grand Prix victory and made a call on the 2025 world title battle. Starting from second on the grid, Piastri won the Belgian Grand Prix ahead of McLaren teammate and title rival Lando Norris, with the Aussie extending his championship lead to 16 points.

Many fans were left fuming, however, as the Sky Sports broadcast once again focused predominantly on Englishman Norris, rather than his race-winning stable mate. With Norris making a series of crucial errors in the closing stages as he attempted to catch Piastri, Brundle instead highlighted his compatriot’s “brilliant charge” on the broadcast. Perhaps the criticism that rained down upon him was fresh on 66-year-old Brundle’s mind when he penned a post-Spa opinion piece for the Sky Sports website. Brundle, who picked up nine podiums in his 12-year career in the premier category, ultimately had some lofty comparisons when assessing Piastri’s drive in Belgium. “It was a champion’s drive from Oscar Piastri in the main race on Sunday at Spa,” he wrote. “The kind of performance reminiscent of the likes of Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, and Max Verstappen in this modern era. “A small error at Stavelot cost him pole position to teammate Lando Norris, who had impressively homed in on peak performance overnight. Never miss the latest sports news from Australia and around the world - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. “But then Piastri read and stalked his championship rival from the eventual rolling start, exited turn one La Source more cleanly, followed closely through Eau Rouge and Radillion, and kept momentum to sweep past into a lead he would not relinquish. “This also gave him the all-important pit stop priority between the two.” Horrendous conditions delayed the start of the race on Sunday, with it finally getting underway behind a safety car. While Piastri jumped his teammate and grabbed the lead in the early stages, Norris was on the better compound tyre for a one-stop strategy. It left the Aussie with a huge fight on his hands to retain the lead, particularly in the closing stages. Brundle had high praise for the Victorian’s effort, stating he “made it look easy”. “Because we waited so unnecessarily long to get underway, the race was much drier than expected, and this meant managing intermediate tyres through their compound destruction phase into a tread-less bald contact patch,” Brundle continued. “The other McLaren side of the garage cleverly agreed with Norris to opt for the hard dry compound tyre, after Piastri’s medium compounds were already fitted the previous lap, which meant Lando wouldn’t have to pit again. “Piastri then had to completely reset and coax his tyres for the remaining 70 per cent of the race, which he did with utter calmness and without error despite Norris coming back at him with increasing chunks each lap. “Basically, he needed to deploy all the driving tools in the toolbox on the day and made it look easy. “Lando was unlucky with having to go an extra lap on the intermediates because they were too close to do a double stack pit stop and then to compound that his stop was slow. “As he said in the cooldown room post-race, ‘I just thought bye-bye Oscar’.” Norris threw away any chance at victory due to those three costly mistakes as Piastri oozed class and kept his cool. As Norris began to close the gap to Piastri, he ran wide at turn 10 and lost more than a second before losing another half a second thanks to a big lockup. With only three laps to go and the margin down to three seconds, Norris once again locked up at turn one and saw the margin blow back out to 4.7 seconds. Those miscalculations ultimately allowed the Aussie to hold off his teammate and secure his sixth win of the season. But fans were left furious at the commentary, which seemed to downplay the Aussie’s masterclass and instead hinted Norris was somewhat unlucky not to win. Piastri’s win was put down to “superior race management”, while Norris’ fate was sealed by “unfortunate miscalculations”. Fans vented their feelings towards the commentary online. “Insufferable dribble coming from Crofty. Piastri, no mistakes on higher degrading tyres with something left in the tank at the end not mentioned at all. Let’s talk about his race management skills, which are superior to Lando’s. The bias of Crofty is oozing out of him,” one fan wrote. “As an Aussie, the absolutely anti-Piastri commentary from Sky Sports has been disgraceful. Brundle and Crofty normally love listening to both of you every race, but today’s obsession with Lando was incredibly biased, English or not,” another said. “Tell Crofty his sh** British Lando bias is getting out of hand! Lando is making mistakes left, right and centre and Croft still has him winning! Even after Oscar crossed the line and won, Croft was STILL crapping on about Norris. It’s time for him to go,” a third added. Brundle noted those errors again when stating his belief – and hopes – for the remainder of the season. “Once again in certain phases we saw the McLarens a second or two clear of the field every lap,” he wrote. “Lando threw caution to the wind, he had nothing to lose, and he had to somehow disturb Oscar’s tyre economy run, but three errors we saw on TV meant he came up short and had to settle for second and a further loss of eight points. “I’ve felt the same way all year, when all the stars align I believe Lando is marginally the faster, but Oscar is more consistent, makes fewer errors, and is more clinical in combat. “And his head is always rock solid. He’ll take some beating in the closing stages now. “Lando will need absolutely all he’s got, all the time, to win this. “We’ve very often seen two championship combatants find an overdrive and move to a scarcely believable level of delivery, it will be interesting to see if that happens over the next three Sprints and 10 GPs.” The Formula 1 season moves to the Hungaroring circuit this weekend for the Hungarian Grand Prix and the only place to see every F1 race live is on Kayo Sports and Foxtel.

    "content": "England have been dealt a devastating blow ahead of the fifth and final Test against India in the wake of controversial scenes. England captain Ben Stokes was Wednesday ruled out of the fifth and deciding Test against India with a shoulder injury. The England and Wales Cricket Board said vice-captain Ollie Pope would now lead the side in the match at the Oval starting Thursday, with England 2-1 up in the five-Test series.

Stokes has struggled with various fitness issues during a series in which he has sent down 140 overs – the most he has bowled in any series. He is the leading wicket-taker on either side with 17 scalps. “I am obviously disappointed to not be able to finish the series,” an emotional Stokes told a pre-match press conference on Wednesday. The 34-year-old, whose career has been blighted by hamstring trouble, added: “I have got a decent tear of one of the (shoulder) muscles I can’t pronounce, I don’t know how to say it, but we took as long as we could to make that decision around that. “A bit of emotion goes into this kind of stuff when you find out what you have done — bowling was ruled out as soon as we got the scan results. “But you need that time chatting with the medical team, Baz (England coach Brendon McCullum), then just 20 minutes to myself out there in the morning just to really be clear around the decision that we made.” England have made four changes after a gruelling drawn fourth Test at Old Trafford, with Jacob Bethell, Josh Tongue and the Surrey pair of Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton all coming into the side. Fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse have both been rested. Spin-bowling all-rounder Bethell makes his first Test appearance of the year, effectively as a replacement for Stokes. Liam Dawson’s return to Test cricket lasted just one match, with England going into the India finale without a specialist spinner. England XI: 1 Zak Crawley, 2 Ben Duckett, 3 Ollie Pope (capt), 4 Joe Root, 5 Harry Brook, 6 Jacob Bethell, 7 Jamie Smith (wk), 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Gus Atkinson, 10 Jamie Overton, 11 Josh Tongue To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Australian riders weren’t just making up the numbers at the Tour de France, they were shaping it. From Kaden Groves’ emotional win to Ben O’Connor’s summit heroics, here’s how the green and gold stood tall on cycling’s biggest stage. The Tour de France may have finished in Paris yesterday under sodden skies but it was definitely a bright outlook for the Australian talent. Ten faced the starter three weeks ago in Lille and nine made it to Paris after Jack Haig crashed at the end of the first week. Kaden Groves was fantastic on Saturday, claiming his maiden Tour de France victory in his debut Tour with a brilliant solo attack 16 kilometres out from the finish in Pontarlier. The Australian, who has won stages at the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a España, burst into tears after crossing the line, overwhelmed at claiming the victory. “There’s so much pressure at the Tour,” Groves said at the finish. “Having won in the Giro and the Vuelta, all I’m asked is whether I’m good enough to win at the Tour. And now I’ve shown them.” Groves is a world-class sprinter but this win was one out of the ordinary as it was a gnarly stage, and to ride away from some quality riders and win alone was special. Fellow Queenslander Harry Sweeny had attempted his own solo attack on the same stage. He opened a gap of 40 seconds before being reeled in, but was awarded the most combative prize. On the monster Queen stage 18, Aussie Ben O’Connor conquered the highest summit of the 2025 Tour de France to claim his first win for Jayco AlUla. What a brilliant ride it was. A 16km solo on the toughest stage of the race in the final week. That’s when many falter, but O’Connor finally found his form in this year’s race. To get in the break is tough. To force the pace and make it stick is hard. But to be then joined by the heavyweights – Tour winner Tadej Pogacar and runner-up Jonas Vingegaard – and be able to ride away from them is bloody serious. His ferocious attack showed just how good the young man from Western Australia is. This was one of the most impressive stage victories ever by an Australian. Last year O’Connor was unstoppable, but after a spectacular crash on day one, he had struggled to find the exceptional form he is capable of. “It’s special to do it again here in the Tour de France,” an elated O’Connor said. “Having that moment today is absolutely massive. You always want another win at the Tour and you can’t get enough of these.” It had been a successful Tour for Jayco, with Mauro Schmid’s oh-so-close second and Luke Plapp’s brilliant time trials. But it needed a win and O’Connor delivered. Team owner Gerry Ryan was overjoyed with the win. “The team have worked hard for this victory,” an excited Ryan said. “But we needed a win. Strong efforts and close finishes may show just how well we’re going, but winning a stage is very important, not just for our riders and sponsors, but for all our staff who work so hard.” Plapp, riding his first Tour de France, was all smiles in Paris. “It’s the most brutal race but the most beautiful race,” he said. “It’s just the hardest race I’ve ever done. I just want to be in Paris every year at the end of July.” Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) rode a super aggressive Tour and whenever the roads rose up he seemed to be there. His third on Stage 6 was impressive. There is no doubt he will challenge again. Many fans believe that the final stage of the Tour de France in Paris is a virtual cakewalk, just a race for the sprinters. Well certainly not this year. The Tour de France organisation is always looking at new innovations and the inclusion of the Côte de la Butte Montmartre in the finale stage was a masterstroke. This was similar to the circuit used for last year’s Olympic road course and it delivered again. A Tour de France winner has never won the final stage in recent memory unless it was a time trial. But Pogacar took the race on and the result was exhilarating racing in the rain. Although he couldn’t match Belgian Wout Van Aert on the final assent, he certainly lit up the race, eventually finishing fourth. O’Connor is capable of anything and a place on the podium at the TdF next year is not out of the question. He started this year’s race with very lofty ambitions but his spectacular crash on day one knocked him around quite a bit and it wasn’t until the final week that we started to see a glimpse of the man who finished second in the Vuelta and the world road title last year. The world title in September in Kigali, Rwanda is very tough and would suit him but, if he rides the Vuelta which he is almost certainly going to do, it may be a bit much. Jayco AlUla teammate, Plapp will certainly be riding the world titles. He looked exhausted after the final day in Paris but he was impressive in both time trials on the Tour and h is a realistic chance to not only get on the podium but take the rainbow jersey. Plapp missed a spot on the podium at the Paris Olympics and the world title because of a crash and a puncture. He has revenge high on the agenda. Sweeny rode a brilliant tour as the strongman for American squad EF Education-Easypost. He was a vital teammate when his leader Ben Healy won a stage and again when he snuck into the Maillot Jaune. I expect Harry to win something special this year. * Former pro cyclist and veteran commentator John Trevorrow is on the ground in France, bringing expert insights and updates on the Aussie riders throughout the Tour for CODE Sports.

It seems now only disaster will stop Tadej Pogacar from claiming his fourth Tour de France at the age of just 26, after a third-place finish in the 19th stage, shortened by a cow disease outbreak.

Robert Whittaker’s bid to be UFC champion again has copped a major blow after he was narrowly beaten by Reiner de Ridder on Sunday morning (AEST). The Australian and Dutchman went the full 25 minutes in an entertaining fight at UFC Fight Night in Abu Dhabi, but de Ridder was given the split decision victory (48-47 x 2, 47-48).

It’s a third victory of the year for ‘RDR’ following wins over Kevin Holland and Bo Nickal. It looked like Whittaker might get the victory when he secured a take-down with a brutal right-hand punch and unleashed some heavy blows on de Ridder early in the fourth round. But de Ridder avoided a stoppage and recovered to land some heavy blows of his own, leaving Whittaker’s nose bloodied, as the Aussie tired in the later rounds. Watch the highlights from Whittaker vs RDR in the video above It was a very close fight, and Whittaker was understandably gutted when the scorecards narrowly went against him as de Ridder claimed his fourth consecutive win. “Pretty butt hurt to be honest,” Whittaker said in the Octogan. “He did what he said he was going to do. I thought I ticked all the boxes, but the pressure was a lot. “He has a lot of skill sets. He’s got a particular way of fighting. I couldn’t really throw too many spanners in the works. “He got it off more times than not and walked away a winner, good on him.” A former UFC middleweight champion, Whittaker’s record is now 26-9, and he faces a tough road back to a title fight after losses to de Ridder and Khamzat Chimaev last year. De Ridder’s record is now 21-2, and he has earned the right to fight some of the biggest names in the middleweight division, calling out Chimaev after the win over Whittaker. De Ridder said: “I expected to take him down and choke him out, but he was amazing. So tough, so durable, heavy f***ing hands. Asked who he wanted to fight next, de Ridder said: “Maybe Khamzat, Dricus (du Plessis) next. Let’s go, give me a chance to fight for that strap.” To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "England captain Ben Stokes insists that he has “no regrets” over the final day handshake drama that sparked widespread backlash. Injured England captain Ben Stokes insists that he does not regret his actions from the final day handshake drama during the drawn fourth Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Old Trafford. Stokes, who will sit out the series finale starting Thursday with a right shoulder injury, offered the draw to Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar at the drinks break in the final session of day five in Manchester, but spat the dummy when the pair of all-rounders refused to shake Stokes’ hand. ï»¿Watch England vs India Test Series LIVE & EXCLUSIVE on Fox Cricket, available on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1.ï»¿ India were four wickets down and led by 71 runs at the time with both Jadeja and Washington closing on centuries - a first in Test cricket for the latter - and Stokes was furious that the two batters wanted to push on to their personal milestones. In an already feisty series, Stokes poured more fuel on the fire by telling Jadeja: “You’re going to get a Test hundred against Harry Brook and Ben Duckett”. He then refused to continue using his front line bowlers and instead allowed Brook to lob up pies in what was an embarrassing end to the Test match. But Stokes says he does not regret how the situation unfolded, nor how he handled it, despite gaining greater perspective on India’s viewpoint. “I don’t have regrets, but it is one of those when you have not been in the field for 250 overs, you do have a bit more of an understanding towards both sides,” Stokes said. “Two lads in Jadeja and Washington played incredibly well up until that point, so you sort of understand as to why as they wanted to stay out there and get their 100s. “But as I said at the end of the game, fair enough but I am not going to bowl my bowlers in a situation where we can’t win the game. “We are over it, I think India are over that whole thing. “Let’s just try our best not to focus on a 20-minute period of cricket when it has been such a great series so far.” The incident was the latest in an ever-growing list throughout the five-Test series which England leads 2-1. Tempers flared in the days leading up to The Oval finale when Indian coach Gautam Gambhir had a run in with head curator Lee Fortis over not being allowed to inspect the pitch up close, and a cool box being put on the square as India practised. Things also got hot under the collar during the third Test at Lords as India did not take kindly to England’s time wasting tactics when they managed to face only one over late on day three despite having to bat for seven minutes. Stokes’ opposite number Shubman Gill, who has been a revelation with the bat since being handed the captaincy making four centuries in the series, was certain in his pre-match press conference that both teams were able to leave the on field spats behind them. “I think I have already explained what happened at Lord’s and about even the incident that happened on the last day in the previous Test,” Gill said. “Both the teams have been very competitive. And sometimes when you are competitive, you know, in the heat of the moment, you do or say things that you might not do (otherwise). “But I think once the match is over, there is mutual respect between both the teams.” Stokes shared similar sentiments, saying that “it has been a tough series, but it has been class to play in”. “It has been a test of characters, a test of physicality, all that kind of stuff, and I think the way each team has fronted up every single day and every single session giving everything for their countries is testament to how much this format means to England and India and every other team in the world,” he added. “The easy option would just be to not turn up and give up, but you have seen both teams turn up every day, give everything, and leave everything out on the field. “I don’t think it will be any different this week.” Stokes is set to be sidelined for six to seven weeks as a result of his shoulder issue, and he is one of four changes to the England XI for the fifth Test. Highly touted 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, who batted at number three during their tour of New Zealand late last year despite never having scored a professional century, will take Stokes’ place at number six. Bethell will also take on the all-rounder duties as a spin option alongside Joe Root with fellow left arm spinner Liam Dawson discarded after playing at Old Trafford following an eight-year hiatus from the Test side. Fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse also make way with Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton all coming into the side to form a four-man pace attack alongside Chris Woakes. Ollie Pope will take on captaincy duties in Stokes absence, as he did for the home series against Sri Lanka and for the first Test of the Pakistan last year. “We have got some incredible leaders out in that 11 still,” Stokes said. “I know I am captain, but I seek advice from quite a few people, and we have got some fantastic cricket brains out there. “We have got a team of 11 match-winners; one person doesn’t win you a game. “Just because I am playing or not, it doesn’t mean we are going to win or lose. “We have had some people put in some special individual performances throughout this series and this is another opportunity for 11 people to be able to put their hand up and hopefully win a game for England as well.” India on the other hand are set to be without superstar fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah as part of the management of his troublesome pack. Entertaining wicket keeper batter Rishabh Pant will also be sidelined with the foot injury he sustained while batting in Manchester, but the final make up of India’s XI remains uncertain.

As some of the biggest names in women’s basketball flock to Indianapolis for WNBA All-Star weekend, there will be one star noticeably absent from the festivities. Fever guard Caitlin Clark, who missed Wednesday’s game in Brooklyn with a groin injury, announced Thursday that she would be pulling out of the 3-point contest and Saturday’s game.

I have to rest my body,” Clark said in a statement. “I will still be at Gainbridge Fieldhouse for all the action, and I’m looking forward to helping [Liberty coach] Sandy [Brondello] coach our team to a win.” Mystics guard Brittney Sykes was tabbed by commissioner Cathy Engelbert to be Clark’s replacement, the NY Post reports. But there’s no doubt Clark being sidelined will cast a shadow larger than her massive banner hanging on the side of the J.W. Marriott in town. Clark, the reigning Rookie of the Year, arguably is the biggest name in women’s basketball and possibly the biggest basketball player in Indianapolis (sorry, Tyrese Haliburton). Clark is averaging a modest 16.2 points, 8.8 assists and five rebounds in 13 games this season. Her shooting splits of 36.7/27.9/82 are noticeably down from a season ago, though she’s been hampered by lower-body injuries. Clark isn’t the only player who’s missing this weekend’s action. Mercury forward Satou Sabally (ankle) and Dream guard Rhyne Howard (knee) also are out with injuries. Dream forward Brionna Jones and Lynx guard Kayla McBride will fill their roster spots.

    "content": "A financial expert has revealed the “dumb” way some Aussies analyse the strength of their super balances - and shared the foolproof way to retire with over $1m. For many Australians, a million in super has been a dream scenario. But it was more than was really necessary. Most Aussies who are retired never even got close and are absolutely fine. But for you? The person who isn’t going to retire for ages? It is possible. It’s actually even likely, if you are young enough. About half of all people aged 30 will end up with a million in super. But which half? A million dollars in super might be pretty nice to have in the future. Because the cost of living keeps going up. If inflation is high enough, a million dollars might be enough to buy Weet-Bix and keep the lights on! In this story we’re going to look at who has what, and who is likely to end up with a million dollars in super. And we are going to look at some amazing graphs. No more averages please When I talk about super, I give the full story. Not just the averages. Averages are, in this context, dumb. Because almost nobody is the average. Super is not like height, where we are all fairly similar and an average is meaningful. When it comes to super, some people are like lego people and some are bigger than giraffes. The following charts break super up by age group. They also break your age group into 20 groups, from the zeroes on the left (no super) to the superheroes on the right (loads of super), and everyone else in the middle, in chunks of 5 per cent. This is useful because it shows you not just the average for your age, but where you stand compared to your peers. You can find yourself in the following charts (there’s one for men and one for women) 1. First find your age group, 2. Then find the tallest column that is less than your super balance. That’s your column. 3. See where your column stands. If it is the tallest you’re in the top 5 per cent, second tallest top 10 per cent, etc. If your bar is near the right side, you’re near the top. If your bar is near the left, you’re closer to the bottom. Each bar is 5 per cent of that age group. The height of the bar is the minimum dollar amount to be in that group. My super balance is just below the second bar for my age group. Which means I’m in the third group – the top 15 per cent for my age. Not too bad, not amazing. My holidays in retirement might be a week at the coast not a month of cruising the Mediterranean, but at least I should get some holidays! Where will I end up? So … who is likely to end up with a million in super? If we make some simplifying assumptions – say everyone puts in $9000 a year and gets 7 per cent returns, we see the following. The charts are the same as the ones above, but I’ve coloured red the people who are able to hit a million by age 60. For women, we see about 20 per cent of those aged 35 to 39 will hit a million by age 60. Those whose balances are over $120,000 now are on their way to seven figures. For women under 30, all of them can hit a million. If they put $9000 a year away for 30 more years and get 7 per cent returns the magic of compounding will get them over the line. The following charts are for men. More men aged 35 to 39 will hit a million in super by age 60 – about 30 per cent of them. Again, all men under 30 can hit a million in super by age 60. In reality not everyone under 30 now will get there by 60. People who have no super at age 30 are not likely to start saving $9000 a year. Putting $9000 a year away is a lot for a person making below average income in 2025, so that assumption is a bit dubious, on the other hand some of these people will still be working in 30 years and at that point $9000 a year won’t be much. The above charts are best thought of as a simplified model of what’s possible. Should you worry about your super? Obviously this is just a projection – a guess, estimate, forecast. If you get promoted to manager or act super frugal you can end up with more than the projection. If someone drops a steel beam on your head or your business goes broke, you end up with less. And if you fall in a fiery volcano the day before your 60th birthday it won’t matter at all. Super works only if civilisation still exists at retirement. And the longer the time frame you’re looking at the harder it is to predict the future. Eighteen year olds aren’t thinking about retirement and honestly good on them. Go have fun. Also, every so often history dishes up a big financial event that crashes markets and destroys wealth. If that arrives in your last five years before retirement, a lot of your good work in saving hard can be undone. The assumption I’ve made – of 7 per cent returns steadily each year – could come to look ridiculously optimistic. For anyone about to retire and stressing about the cost of living in retirement there is comfort in the knowledge that the pension is going to be there. Politicians have raised the pension age to 67 but no further rises are planned.

    "content": "Fresh holiday photos of all the Beckhams have incidentally exposed just how deep the alleged “feud” could be running. Brooklyn Beckham can’t escape reports that he is feuding with his parents, David and Victoria Beckham, and these separate holiday photos certainly aren’t helping things. The 26-year-old is the eldest son of the acclaimed soccer player and former Spice Girl (although once a Spice Girl, always a Spice Girl, right?), and it appears he has fallen out with his famous parents. Page Six reported that Brooklyn has been “no contact” with David and Victoria since June 2025 due to a myriad of issues. The family, though, has been reportedly in on again/off again turmoil since Brooklyn married billionaire heiress Nicola Peltz-Beckham in 2022 after a whirlwind 8-month romance. The 26-year-old has been spending the summer on vacation in St Tropez with his wife and her family. The billionaire gang has been seen hanging out on an $85 million, 80-metre yacht called Project X that costs $1.2 million to charter weekly. They’ve been having quite the time. Brooklyn was seen parading around his hot sauce brand Cloud23 on a jetski, and Nicola found time in her busy schedule to post a nude photo on Instagram. Two days later, his parents and siblings arrived in St Tropez and boarded a separate $16 million yacht named Seven. Brooklyn and Nicola didn’t join them. To increase the awkwardness, days earlier Brooklyn was strutting around on a ship double the size of the one his family boarded. Project X has a crew of 28, meanwhile, David and Victoria’s yacht was half the size and typically has around seven crew members on board. The facts are that Brooklyn’s just been on the same holiday as the rest of his family, but his version was just richer and fancier. He also didn’t stick around to hang out with them, which seems odd. He runs a hot sauce company, but he isn’t running out of annual leave or anything. So what happened? None of the Beckhams have spoken out over the alleged feud, but multiple insiders have spoken to various outlets, and the storyline is pretty similar. PageSix has reported sources claim Nicola is very “sensitive” and that David and Victoria have always been “loving parents”. Sources familiar with the other side of the story claim Brooklyn is leaning on his wife’s family and moving away from the “brand Beckham” focus to forge his own path. For instance, his hot sauce line doesn’t feature his last name. The wedding that ended with Nicola in tears It is obvious that something has shifted, as before tying the knot in 2022, Brooklyn was close with his family. He was constantly seen hanging out with his entire family including his siblings, Romeo, 22, a model and soccer player, Cruz, 20, a musician, and Harper, 14. Back in 2018, David burst into tears when Brooklyn surprised him for his birthday and now Brooklyn appears to be avoiding the entire brood. It is hard to know when things fell apart but things did seem to become strained directly after his wedding, during which Nicola famously didn’t wear one of her mother-in-law Victoria’s designs. There was immediately speculation that there was some kind of feud, and Nicola has tried multiple times to squash rumours, but with little success. She did address it directly, telling Variety that she was going to wear a Victoria Beckham design, but it just didn’t work out. “I was going to do it and I really wanted to, and then a few months later, she realised that her atelier couldn’t do it, so I had to choose another dress,” she explained. It is slightly hard to imagine that someone as powerful as Victoria couldn’t get a dress altered in time for her daughter-in-law’s wedding, but that was Nicola’s explanation ENews has also claimed that tensions at their wedding were heightened because singer Marc Anthony, who was performing, called Victoria Beckham “the most beautiful woman in the room”, causing Nicola, the bride, to leave the room “crying”, though she eventually returned. Brooklyn’s relationship with his family has reportedly been precarious ever since and this year things have really taken a dive. The 26-year-old didn’t attend his dad’s 50th birthday or wish him a happy birthday on social media, didn’t shout out his dad on Father’s Day, or acknowledge David being named in the King’s birthday honours. He also ignored his mum and dad’s 26th wedding anniversary and his mother’s birthday, but did acknowledge his billionaire father-in-law Nelson Peltz’s birthday. The alleged feud has also sparked a narrative online that Nicola is somehow “controlling” Brooklyn. The heiress hasn’t addressed the rumours, but liked a telling comment on her Instagram account. “The fact people are in this comment section talking bs about someone controlling a GROWN man is absurd,” the fan wrote. “The guy is an adult and can make his own decisions, leave them be and stop blaming women for everything.” Brooklyn’s alleged ‘falling out’ with his brothers Meanwhile Brooklyn’s relationship with his brothers appears to be fractured. Romeo, Cruz have been posting about their family holiday on Instagram, commenting on each other’s photos. Not that Brooklyn would be able to see any of this because he unfollowed both his brothers on Instagram, although he does still follow his parents. The unfollow happened around the time that his younger brother, Cruz, debuted his new romance with Kim Turnbull in May. There were rumours that Brooklyn and Turnbull had previously hooked up. Cruz eventually took to Instagram and claimed Turnbull had “never dated” his brother. This is all slightly irrelevant now, because by July their relationship was over, but even if that isn’t true, there’s still clearly tension between the brothers. Cruz made a public dig at Brooklyn on TikTok when he was being trolled over his music career in July. When someone asked him if he was going to “stick with this job or become a race car driver next?” Cruz replied, “Wrong, brother, mate”. Cruz’s reply seems like a pretty clear jab at Brooklyn, who has had quite the career path, where he has dabbled in everything from photography, modelling, acting and, now, building a hot sauce empire. A real estate agent, who recently sold Mick Fanning’s home for more than $16million, has been banned from one the country’s most exclusive restaurants for life. One of the alleged ringleaders of a “large-scale” loan fraud scheme has been arrested at Crown casino wearing a Louis Vuitton bomber jacket. “It’s funny thinking about how we used to hang out together and play together, and now we’ve won this together,” one of the winning mates said.

    "content": "Borrowers hoping for relief from strict lending rules have been dealt a blow as regulators refuse to budge on tough mortgage stress tests. ANALYSIS If you’re in mortgage prison, you just had a parole hearing. And the result? Parole denied. That was the outcome when the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) announced recently that it would be keeping the 3 per cent mortgage repayment ‘stress test’ buffer in place. That’s right, we’re not being prudent enough! And we must be regulated. The buffer dictates that anyone applying for a home loan is ‘stress tested’ at a loan repayment rate 3 per cent higher than what they will actually be paying if successful in their loan application. MORE: Shock RBA twist as home prices surge So, if you want to borrow money at 6 per cent, the bank will check your income and financial habits to make sure you could make repayments at 9 per cent interest. You know, just in case there is a series of rate rises. They don’t want you to default and lose that dream home. Only problem is, for a lot of people, the rule is stopping them getting a home at all. Let’s be real here. Interest rates are coming down. They are not going to go up 3 per cent in the near term. The stress buffer started out at 2 per cent in 2014. It went to 2.5 per cent in 2019 on the back of a growth cycle that left many borrowers overexposed to the risk of a market correction. It was rightly increased to 3 per cent in October 2021 when the official cash rate was at 0.1 per cent and there were variable rate home loans with interest rates below 2 per cent. The only way was up at that time. Now is a completely different story. We have seen a cost of living crisis, stagnant wages, and rising house prices, yet someone who has somehow managed to scrape a deposit together needs to be able to show they can make repayments at a level not seen from variable interest rates since before the 2008 GFC. MORE: 34-year-old goes from broke to $100m This is especially difficult for young people, as noted by my colleague Jonathan Chancellor in his Sydney Weekend column, who quoted Michael Sukkar, the Coalition’s shadow housing minster during the 2025 election campaign, criticising APRA’s “one size fits all” rule as preventing nearly 40 per cent of first home buyers from getting a loan. That type of outcome is disastrous for future generations. But possibly the most absurd thing is that some people already with a mortgage who are struggling to make repayments might see a loan out there with a lower interest rate, but they won’t be able to refinance to it because they don’t pass the stress test. They might be paying 6 per cent currently, but if they wanted to pay 5.5 per cent, they’d have to prove they can pay 8.5 per cent. MORE:Aus bank slashes rates to lowest level in two years Just that 0.5 per cent difference would save you more than $300 a month on a $1 million mortgage and $114,000 over 30 years. Granted, there is a workaround for some lenders, who are able to use discretion to assess some borrowers at 1 or 2 per cent buffers, but for those who don’t qualify? They are stuck in mortgage prison. And it’s looking like APRA hasn’t just left the keys in its ‘other pants’, but has thrown them away altogether. The 3 per cent buffer stayed in place even when the cash rate was at 4.35 per cent and there were borrowers being assessed at 10 per cent in order to get a 7 per cent home loan. Now that the cash rate and variable rates are both on the way down, adjusting the buffer is becoming less urgent, so expect more borrowers to miss out as APRA stays firm.

Outback Wrangler Matt Wright is offering to throw in a 4.5m saltie named ‘Spicy’ with the sale of his Darwin home. Though not a first in the Top End, the snappy inclusion doesn’t pop up often in the Territory market. In an Instagram reel posted Friday morning Wright made the offer to include the saltwater croc, who already has his own pen on Virginia property. “If you really, really want the place, I’ll even leave ya with Spicy,” he said. “If you really want the place, you get him with it.” RELATED: Darwin home prices hit new high Rev head thirst trap racks up 36k views Own your own fairway minutes from prime fishing for under $700k During the online video, Wright gave a tour of the “cracking place” with commentary. He proudly showed off his crazy pave driveway – twice. “Look at those amazing crazy paves – heart, sweat and tears went into that,” he said. And revealed a view of the croc pen from his upstairs balcony. “That’s where the big dog hangs out, down there,” he said. Wright invited his followers to an open home on Sunday – though not everyone would be welcome. “There is a home invasion this weekend,” he said “You’re welcome to come on the Sunday. “One condition – no media or tyre kickers. “We don’t want them kicking around.” The property at 124 Virginia Rd, Virginia, is for sale with a price guide of $1.39m through Ryan Rowsell and Andrew Harding of Ray White Darwin. An open house is scheduled for Sunday, August 3, from 10-11am. Wright and his wife, Kaia, bought the block nine years ago and transformed the house from a typical Darwin elevated into a minimalist masterpiece. Mrs Wright said the home now felt like a modern treehouse with walls of glass and sleek open spaces. “You feel like you’re up in the mahogany trees,” she said. “It’s so light and uplifting.” Mrs Wright said she was inspired by brutalist architecture and raw materials and wanted to create a no fuss home of concrete, timber, glass and natural textures. “We had to work with what we had, which was an old Darwin elevated home,” she said. “So I wanted to get rid of the louvres and simplify the house.” The home has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a self-contained unit downstairs and high-end finishes and fixtures including Taj Mahal stone and quartzite benchtops, venetian plaster and Murano glass.

    "content": "Comments from RBA governor Michele Bullock and weaker than expected quarterly earnings dropped the ASX on Thursday. Australia’s sharemarket slid during Thursday’s trading as disappointing quarterly updates and a speech by Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock weighed on the market. The benchmark ASX 200 closed lower on Thursday dropping 27.80 points or 0.32 per cent to 8,709.40 points while the broader All Ordinaries slipped 22 points or 02.4 per cent to 8,979.40. The Aussie dollar jumped 0.19 per cent and is now buying 66.11 US cents. All sectors except health care closed in the red, with the falls led by industrials, property, consumer discretionary and energy stocks. Market heavyweight CSL gained 1.53 per cent to $269.56, while ResMed gained 0.44 per cent to $41.10 and Cochlear closed 0.03 per cent higher to $314.01. Three of the four major banks also finished in the green, despite the sector as a whole falling. CBA eked out a 0.10 per cent gain to $173.47, NAB jumped 1.24 per cent to $37.66 and Westpac finished 0.54 per cent higher to $33.29. ANZ was the outlier sliding 0.43 per cent to $30.44. After jumping on the opening bell, shares subsequently fell after RBA governor Michele Bullock made her speech at the Annika Foundation lunch. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said the market’s confidence in a rate cut in August slipped after the speech. “The RBA governor has elected to look through the recent criticism and, in her speech, downplayed the rise in employment saying it wasn’t a surprise,” he wrote in a market note. “She also noted that monthly inflation data suggests the inflation rate may not fall as fast as forecast in May.” Following Ms Bullock’s speech the markets knocked off about five basis points or RBA rate cuts by the end of the year. In company news earnings results disappointed on Thursday. Macquarie shares dived 5.08 per cent to $213.84 after telling the market longstanding chief financial officer Alex Harvey will retire mid-2026 as well as announcing its first quarter data. Macquarie, which is broken up into four business segments, said its banking and financial services and Macquarie capital improved performance over the three months until June 30. But its Macquarie Asset Management and Commodities and Global Markets segments slipped. Overall Macquarie Group reported a $3.7bn profit for FY25. It was also a disappointing trading update for Bapcor with shares slumping to a five-year low after the Autobarn and Midas owner said statutory net profits after tax would lie between $31 to $34m. Shares in the company slumped 28.38 per cent to $3.66 on the announcement. In a positive trading update Fortescue shares jumped 4.34 per cent to $19 after the investing giant announced its fourth quarter update showing it shipped a record-breaking annual shipment of 198.4Mt in FY 2025. Lynas Rare Earths gained 5.03 per cent to $10.65 after its shipment jumped 38 per cent compared to the prior quarter. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

    "content": "Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said. Donald Trump personally called for Australia to keep its baseline 10 per cent tariff rate despite “some pressure in the American system,” Trade Minister Don Farrell has said. Australia was just one of the few countries to not be hit by steeper tariffs after the extended deadline for negotiations lapsed on Friday. Senator Farrell said this was “vindication” for Labor’s “cool and calm negotiations”. He said discussions with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the steady rate, despite lobbying from other parts of the Trump administration. “He indicated there had been some pressure on the American system for an increase, but that President Trump had decided to maintain that 10 per cent,” he said. “I think this is a vindication for the Albanese government, and particularly the Prime Minister, in the cool and calm way we have conducted diplomacy with the United States.” He said that Australia having one of the lowest baseline tariff rates would make Australian products not just more competitive in the US market, but it would also promote trade with other countries too. “What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market,” he said. “This means product like wine, beef, lamb, wheat, in a relative sense, are cheaper (when sold) into the United States. “As a government, we will assist all of our exporters in ensuring we take advantage of this situation and increase the volume of exports, not just to the US, but all of those other countries that we have diversified with.” Senator Farrell said Australia would continue to advocate for a tariff exemption, adding that Mr Lutnick had been invited to Australia to continue talks. “We believe in free and fair trade, and we will continue to put the argument to the US that they should remove all tariffs on Australian products in accordance with our free trade agreement, and we will continue to prosecute that argument,” he said. “I have invited Secretary Lutnick to come to Australia to continue the discussions.” Australia’s defence pact AUKUS will still be discussed separately from trade, with Senator Farrell saying he was confident the US would continue with the agreement. This is despite AUKUS sceptic Elbridge Colby currently conducting a review into the deal, currently set to be completed in the next two to four months. Countries get hit with tariff hikes On Friday, Mr Trump signed in higher rates for many countries under a new executive order, but the tariff on Australian imports will remain at the original baseline of 10 per cent. The US leader had earlier threatened to increase tariffs on Australia to 15 or 20 per cent. In a statement from Thursday morning, the Whitehouse said President Trump had decided to “adjust” his “reciprocal” tariff regime, first announced on April 2, in response to trade negotiations with individual countries. “Several countries have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade deals and security agreements with the United States,” the statements reads. “Some countries, through negotiations, have offered terms that, in the President’s judgment, do not sufficiently address the national emergency he declared on April 2. “Some countries have not negotiated at all with the United States. “Based on this additional information and recommendations from senior officials, among other things, the President has determined that it is necessary and appropriate to modify the reciprocal tariff rates for certain countries.” The Whitehouse then lists a set of countries under “Annex 1”, with individual tariff rates set out for each nation. “Countries not listed in Annex I will be subject to a 10 per cent tariff,” the Whitehouse said. Australia is not included in Annex 1. Several countries, including ostensible US allies, now face steeper import duties. Canada has been whacked with a higher 35 per cent tariff, a move up from its original 25 per cent hit. Taiwan, a key US ally in Asia, faces a 20 per cent rate. Small nations with tiny economies have also been slammed. The Pacific country of Vanuatu, with a population of some 330,000, faces a 15 per cent tariff, while Laos has copped a 40 per cent tariff blow. A tariff is a tax placed on imports and steep tariffs can effectively cripple exports. The hold at 10 per cent is likely to engender relief in Australian business and political circles. However Coalition trade spokesman Kevin Hogan said it was “very disappointing” Australia wasn’t given advanced notice of Mr Trump’s decision ahead of Friday’s announcement. Mr Hogan said this was because Anthony Albanese had not “prioritised the relationship” with Mr Trump, with the pair yet to meet in person. A potential face-to-face could occur during the Quad meeting in India or during a trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, both in September. While Senator Farrell should not second-guess when a future meeting would occur he said these will happen at “the appropriate time”. “Obviously, this decision by the United States government is a very positive one for our relationship,” he said. Aus’ tariff reprieve follows US beef change The hold comes one week after the Albanese government agreed to allow beef imports from North America into the domestic market. The government denied the timing of the decision had anything to do with drawn-out tariff exemption talks with the US. Cattle producers have flagged biosecurity risks to the move, but the government insists beef sourced from Canada and Mexico and processed in the US would be safe. “It was not a trade decision … the American systems were assessed by our independent officials over the last several months and found to be up to scratch,” Health Minister Mark Butler said. IG markets analyst Tony Sycamore said the initial market reaction to news had been “relatively subdued”, but retaliatory tariffs from impacted countries could trigger volatility. “Market reactions to the newly announced tariffs have been relatively subdued, largely due to recent trade agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea and others that have mitigated their impact,” he said. “What could change this situation, is retaliatory tariffs from impacted countries which in turn could lead to higher tariffs from the US than the ones announced this morning.” Government staff in one Aussie state who are looking down the barrel of mass job cuts have been left fuming following a video call update. While Australia dodged the worst of America’s trade war, experts warn the fallout will still impact everything from mortgages to medicine costs.

A well-known Australian fashion retailer will oppose a proposal to wind-up the business after it was hit with legal action over alleged debts, court documents reveal. General Pants Co was served with an insolvency claim on July 17 by supplier UCC Australia alleging the chain had failed to pay $69,835.92 owed for stock delivered. According to a winding up application filed in the Victorian Supreme Court, UCC Australia alleged it had unpaid invoices for the supply of cameras and film between October and December 2024. “The goods were delivered and accepted by the debtor and the invoiced amounts remain due and payable,” the document states. The supplier sent General Pants Co a statutory demand for on June 17, requiring the alleged debt be paid within 21 days of service. According to the court documents, General Pants Co failed to comply with the demand, with UCC Australia seeking a court order for a liquidator to be appointed to the company. The matter has been listed before a Judicial Registrar on August 20. But in a two-page response filed with the court on July 24, lawyers acting for General Pants Co signalled their intention to appear at the hearing and oppose the application. The response claims the company opposes the application because the company is solvent and has paid UCC Australia’s debt. General Pants Co has been a staple in Australian fashion for more than 50 years and has 55 stores across Australia and New Zealand. UCC is an importer, distributor and wholesaler of FMCG, supplying electricals and food to some of Australia’s major retailers, including Myer, Big W, Kmart, Woolworths and Amazon. Online grocery shoppers were hit with unexpected duplicate charges weeks after their Coles deliveries were completed, with the company apologising. End-of-financial-year sales and Australians flocking to one electrical item have triggered an unexpected retail boom.

    "content": "Australian shares have bounced back as major banks recover and Trump’s EU trade deal boosts investor confidence across global markets. Australia’s sharemarket snapped a brief two day losing streak on Monday after US President Donald Trump announced his latest trade deal and the major banks bounced back from their recent falls. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed up 30.8 points or 0.36 per cent at 8697.7 after hitting an intraday high of 8704.9, while the broader All Ordinaries finished in the green up 29.20 points or 0.33 per cent to 8,963.50. The Australian dollar slipped from a nine-month high on Friday buying 65.51 US cents at the time of writing. On an overall positive day, eight of the 11 sectors finished in the green, led by the telecommunications sector, the big four banks and healthcare stocks. Shares in Telstra gained 0.81 per cent to $4.95, REA Group jumped 1.34 per cent to $236.09 and CAR group added 1.72 per cent to $37.89. Market heavyweight CBA gained 1.17 per cent to $174.90 offsetting half the falls in recent days, while NAB gained 0.67 per cent to $37.76, Westpac added 0.54 per cent to $33.21 and ANZ group closed 0.30 per cent higher at $30.31. Healthcare darling CSL gained 1 per cent to $270.59, Sigma Healthcare added 1.41 per cent to $2.88 and ResMed finished 0.97 per cent higher to $41.70. The markets jumped after US President Donald Trump announced a deal with the EU to end four months of negotiations between the two economic powerhouses. Following the discussions, the EU will face a 15 per cent tariff from the US, which is down from the 25 per cent the President announced in April. European Commission chief Ursula von de Leyen described it as “a big deal, a huge deal, bringing: stability and predictability” to the two trading partners. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said global markets around the world jumped on these trade deals. “In terms of the trade deals with Japan and Europe, the tariff rate that will be implemented came in lower than initially threatened and the market is looking very positively on it,” Mr Sycamore said.

    "content": "Lawyers are investigating a potential class action lawsuit against two collapsed super funds, saying Aussies could lose more than $1bn in superannuation. Lawyers are investigating a potential class action on behalf of investors in First Guardian Master Fund and Shield Master Fund, alleging they operated a Ponzi scheme with thousands of Australians’ superannuation savings. Slater and Gordon Lawyers say more than 12,000 Australians could be affected, with fears Aussies could lose more than $1bn to the collapsed funds. Slater and Gordon principal lawyer in class actions Andy Wei alleged investors were advised to put their savings into “largely unreliable funds”. “What we’re seeing here is potentially deliberate misleading of investors, many of whom are everyday Australians looking to secure their nest eggs,” Mr Wei said. “They were repeatedly assured that their superannuation would flow into diversified portfolios with steady returns.”He said despite this assurance, “recent information shows that these funds were largely illiquid with their values grossly overstated”. Illiquid assets are investments that cannot be converted into cash or easily sold without significant loss in value. This includes property developments, private loans or unlisted securities. Mr Wei said there was a chance that more than 12,000 Australians could be left out of pocket, with more than $1bn in superannuation “potentially wiped out”. “These are people’s savings, and they deserve far better than this,” he said. “Superannuation is meant to be tightly regulated, and many investors likely believed their money was safely managed by trusted, blue-chip superannuation companies.” A Slater and Gordon spokesman alleged the investment funds were operating a Ponzi scheme with thousands of Australians’ superannuation, based on conduct issues “observed” by FTI Consulting liquidators. “Slater and Gordon understand that the liquidators of First Guardian have observed issues arising from co-mingling of investor funds, such that investors’ monies were mixed up and used to pay for other investors’ redemptions, or investment commitments and management fees, when ordinarily those redemptions, commitments and fees should have come from income generated through investment activities,” they told NewsWire. “Conduct of this kind is common to that seen in Ponzi schemes, and how this was allowed to occur forms a part of our investigation.” Mr Wei said he was particularly concerned for those who invested in the First Guardian fund, as the FTI Consulting liquidators had now confirmed they expected “a substantial shortfall of recoverable assets”. He encouraged investors who had been affected to come forward and contact the Slater and Gordon firm, saying more information would help them assess the “best path for recovery”, including whether a class action is viable. First Guardian Master Fund collapsed earlier this year, leaving thousands of customers in the lurch and unsure if they will ever see their funds again. FTI Consulting liquidators Paul Harlond and Ross Blakely, who released their preliminary report into the fund, said they “intend to undertake further investigations”. These included the determination of “whether any breaches of the Corporations Act or any other laws have occurred by any party … or any other circumstances exist, which may give rise to a potential claim by investors”. In the report, the liquidators said they were “seeking compensation on behalf of members of the fund for losses suffered”, which could be as much as $446m. FTI Consulting’s assessment found the overall recoverable value of the investments was likely to be “considerably less than their combined book value”, and a “substantial shortfall of recoverable assets to outstanding investor funds” was therefore likely arise in the liquidation. The liquidators said it would take more than a year to complete their investigation and wind up the business due to the “complexity and number of outstanding matters” in the liquidation. “The liquidators consider that the liquidation and the winding up of the funds will continue for and take some time to complete,” the report read. Corporate watchdog Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) launched an investigation into the failed management investment scheme and Falcon Capital Limited, the entity responsible for the scheme. Without commenting on the Slater and Gordon claims and, separate to the Ponzi scheme allegation, an ASIC spokesman said its “first priority has been to preserve any remaining assets of the scheme so they can be recovered for investors”. “Following concerns raised by ASIC, the Federal Court appointed liquidators to Falcon Capital and ordered the wind-up of First Guardian and its related funds in April,” they said. “The court also restrained David Anderson, a director of Falcon, from dealing with his assets and appointed a receiver to his personal property. “ASIC’s investigation suggests that potential consumers were called and referred to personal financial advice providers who advised consumers to roll their superannuation assets into a retail choice superannuation fund, and then to invest part or all of their superannuation into First Guardian. “While ASIC’s investigation is ongoing, the Federal Court has made interim travel restraint orders against Falcon Capital director David Anderson on ASIC’s application. “The Court also made interim orders freezing the assets of another Falcon director, Simon Selimaj and restraining his travel.” Those orders are in place until February 27, 2026. No charges have been laid. A financial expert has revealed the “dumb” way some Aussies analyse the strength of their super balances - and shared the foolproof way to retire with over $1m.

    "content": "A fresh warning bell is ringing for the Aussie economy, with one analyst saying the country has entered a “flat patch”. Business revenues declined in May for the first time since late 2024 in a fresh warning bell for Australia’s stumbling economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed the dip in its latest data release on business turnover, which covers total income generated from sales before taking out expenses. A slump in arts and recreation services propelled the decline, with the category tumbling 5.5 per cent over the month. Manufacturing declined 1.3 per cent and retail slipped 0.8 per cent. Altogether, turnover in five of 13 industries fell. “This is the first fall in monthly business turnover since October 2024,” ABS head of business statistics Robert Ewing said. “Softening the fall, we saw rises in electricity, gas, water and waste services, up 1.7 per cent, and wholesale trade, up 1.1 per cent.” IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said May’s numbers suggested Australia’s economy had entered a “flat patch”. “It supports other data that indicates the economy remains in a flat patch, with the softness in retail sales confirming the idea that households remain cautious,” he said. “This reinforces the need for additional monetary policy easing from the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) to boost sentiment and growth prospects for the Australian economy into the end of 2025.” Compared with May 2024, however, overall turnover was 3.3 per cent higher for the month, the ABS said. May’s dip follows a shock decision from the RBA on Tuesday to hold the cash rate at 3.85 per cent, defying expectations from expert commentators and the money markets. RBA governor Michele Bullock wanted to wait for the June quarter inflation numbers – scheduled for release on July 20 – before moving on rates. “We just want to confirm with a full quarterly CPI that we’re still on track to deliver inflation continuing down to the middle of the band over time,” she said in response to a question from NewsWire. “That’s the reason we’re waiting. We decided to hold and we’ll reconsider again in August with this extra information and new forecasts.” bRight Agent co-founder Aaron Scott called the hold a “cruel blow” for millions of Australian homeowners. “Despite the fact that a July cut would not have been enough to give most mortgage holders a meaningful reprieve, it would have been welcome by the millions of Aussies who are holding out for more cost-of-living relief,” he said on Tuesday. “Nobody will be breaking out the Wagyu beef or shiraz.” On Thursday, banking giant Commonwealth Bank also warned that households remained cautious. “While we still anticipate a pick-up in household spending in 2025, a slower rate-cutting cycle could soften this recovery over the remainder of the year,” CBA senior economist Belinda Allen said. Consumer spending lifted 0.3 per cent in June, the bank’s closely watched household spending index revealed, for a third month of gains following rises of 0.4 per cent in both April and May. Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said. While Australia dodged the worst of America’s trade war, experts warn the fallout will still impact everything from mortgages to medicine costs.

    "content": "An extraordinary screaming match has erupted at a Sydney council meeting after a local member told his female colleague to “shut up when I’m talking”. An extraordinary screaming match has erupted at a western Sydney council meeting after a local member told his female colleague to “shut up when I’m talking”. Labor Mayor Ola Hamed was forced to call a 15-minute adjournment during Cumberland City Council’s meeting on Wednesday night after the shocking row exploded between Ahmed Ouf and Diane Colman, who leapt to her feet and screamed, “You cannot speak to me like that!” Cr Ouf, an independent, was speaking in support of a motion about the city’s 2026 Easter Extravaganza nearly two hours into the meeting, when he hit out at apparent interjections from the Labor councillor. “Can you just shut up when I’m talking, OK?” Cr Ouf snapped. “I beg your pardon, Councillor,” Mayor Hamed interjected. “When I’m talking this is my time, not your time,” Cr Ouf told Cr Colman. “When I talk, you shut up, OK?” “Oh, point of order, Mayor, point of order!” Cr Colman called out. Cr Ouf asked, “Why is she talking while I’m talking? Why is she taking from my time?” Cr Colman yelled back across the chamber, “How dare you!” Cr Ouf hit back, “You just keep your mouth shut while I’m talking. I never, ever spoke when you were talking or having time.” At that point Cr Colman leapt to her feet and exploded. “You cannot speak to me like that!” she screamed. “You show respect! You show respect!” Cr Ouf yelled back. “You show me some respect!” Cr Colman went on. “How dare you speak to me like that! How dare you!” Cr Ouf said he was “not intimidated, not 100 of you”. Cr Colman screamed again, “How dare you? Who you think you’re speaking to?” Cr Ouf told her, “Then show respect so you can be respected. When I’m talking, you stay shut.” Mayor Hamed then called an adjournment. “This isn’t the first time women councillors have been publicly disrespected at Cumberland Council, as you can see by my reaction,” Cr Colman told news.com.au on Friday. “There’s been a pattern of bad behaviour towards women on our council for a very long time.” She noted that a 2023 survey by the Australian Local Government Women’s Association (ALGWA), where she sits on the board, found 61 per cent of female councillors had experienced bullying and harassment. “This is a direct demonstration of the misogyny that’s endemic in our society,” she said. “For too long women in leadership have had to put up with it.” Cr Colman said there were “three or four people” who had attempted to correct a comment by Cr Ouf but “he singled me out”. “I was very shocked because I’ve never had anything but cordial dealings with Cr Ouf,” she said. “I think he really showed his true colours.” Cr Ouf insisted that it “has nothing to do with gender, the get-out-of-jail-free card which is misogyny”. He conceded he “should have used another word” but said his comment to “shut up” was “in the heat of the moment”. “She started interrupting me, harassing me while I’m speaking,” he told news.com.au. “All I wanted was just let me speak, respect me, I respect you, give me my time, do not interrupt. This has nothing to do with skin colour or gender. If she did not interrupt me or harass me I would not have done what I’ve done. You can go back to my record, I’ve never interrupted or harassed any of my colleagues trying to cut them down.” Cr Ouf added he was interrupted “while speaking on behalf of a minority”, the religious group Falun Dafa, who experience persecution in China. He said a Falun Dafa woman who was present, the only member of the public in the gallery, was left in tears by the scene. “I support everyone, I love everyone, I respect everyone,” he said. Libertarian Councillor Steve Christou, who shared a viral clip of the blow-up on social media, has sided with Cr Ouf. He claimed Cr Colman “was interjecting during his speech”. “Mind you, no one was interjecting Cr Colman all night,” he told news.com.au. “I’ve previously had run-ins before with Cr Colman interjecting [during] my speeches. Yes, Ahmed told her to shut up in frustration, but Cr Colman had a meltdown of epic proportions. It continued after the camera went off. Quite frankly it created a very unhealthy and unsafe workplace environment, not just for councillors but for the poor staff who had to witness this behaviour and work through it.” Cr Christou said it was unclear exactly what the alleged interjections were about. “She was making some kind of remarks, they were a bit inaudible,” he said. “She claims she was trying to correct him on something he had stated. He was speaking on the Easter motion but then he turned his attention to Falun Dafa and whether we should acknowledge it in Cumberland or not. I think he was questioned on ‘why are you raising Falun Dafa’. But she was interjecting, speaking while he was speaking. In all honesty you can’t just stir something up and instigate an issue and then claim misogyny.” Cr Christou said in “any other workplace there would have been disciplinary action and instant dismissal”. “This needs to be looked into, you can’t rug pull it, someone has to speak up,” he said. “I’ve previously raised concerns about behaviours. At some point, just because you’re in the public sphere doesn’t mean you get a free pass to do what you want. No other workplace would tolerate this type of behaviour.” Cr Christou said Cumberland ratepayers “deserve better”, particularly after a 7.1 per cent rate hike last month.

At just 34, this Aussie beat poverty and a rough start in public housing at Mt Druitt, to rack up an incredible 158 homes owned, around 16 bought this year alone. Eddie Dilleen is among those who beat the odds where he grew up with a single mother, surviving off cheap public housing and Centrelink in one of the roughest neighbourhoods in Sydney’s west. His horror start in life saw him promise to never be in that situation again, driving him to the point where he just can’t stop buying homes – with his housing investment portfolio increasing a shocking 50 per cent in the past year alone from circa 100 homes this time last year to 158 now. MORE: Aus bank slashes rates to 2-year low All the tax write offs Aussies can claim The secret to his surge in rental count, he told The Courier-Mail, was bulk buying, picking up entire unit blocks of five or six homes at a time – something which he has begun doing in partnership with other buyers to share the Costco-style discounts off mass purchasing and drive his purchasing power further. “When entire existing complexes of townhouses, villas and unit blocks need to be sold in one line and I can’t personally buy them all I bring clients into the deals.” “Most have an immediate $200k instant equity within the deal, based of individual valuations, the buyers agency clients pay us a fee of circa $25k, in return they pocket $150-200k instant equity.” It’s a strategy he used to great effect for himself for years, which has seen him go through a meteoric rise in property numbers. “I’m personally up to around 158 properties in my portfolio, worth over $100m combined,” he said. RELATED: Millennial’s secret $200k discounts revealed MORE: Cash-strap student turns $40k to 38 homes Govt pays $3.3m for unliveable derelict house “A couple recent purchases I’ve bought myself are a block of six townhouses – waterfront in Margate, a block of five units in Zillmere, and a block of five units in Melbourne.” The Margate Parade property in Brisbane’s north has 13 bedrooms, six bathrooms and seven carparking on a 776sq m block. It was sold for $3.6m in April this year – a stunning purchase that would be ripe for future upgrades given its absolute waterfront setting, multi-residential status, durable brick and block build and low maintenance. When he bought it, the property was fully leased with long term tenants, yielding around $150,000 a year in an area where the median rent is around $510 a week. His Zillmere Road block of units in Brisbane’s northside was bought in March this year for about $1.6m, seeing each unit come in about $320,000. The building is on a huge 812sq m site, housing five units – four two-bedroom units and 1 one-bedroom unit, all tenanted. “The property is zoned for low-medium density residential use, allowing for potential redevelopment (subject to council approval) into a two to three-storey mixed-use building or the opportunity to renovate the existing units,” was how it was sold to him. His block of five villas in Melbourne were bought for $1.67m, coming in at “only $334k per villa”, he said.

The villas were on one title and ripe for renovation/redevelopment, and even subdivision potential. When he bought it the property was listed as having annual rental return of approximately $100,000. Each of the units has two bedrooms with built-in robes, some updated, others in original condition, with each having their own private courtyard. Mr Dilleen said “people need minimum of about $100k savings or available equity to get into a deal like this” with others as part of Dilleen Property’s group bulk buying strategy. “For example, a $677k deal, 5pc deposit, stamp duty, buyers agency fee comes to less than $90k but they received $200k equity in return, essentially more than doubling their return on capital instantly.” “This strategy is extremely niche and people can’t do this alone as it requires having unconditional buyers ready and the know how of how to legally structure the deal,” he said. The move is his latest strategy to constantly find ways to keep buying worthwhile investment properties – many of which he will never see in his lifetime but which will boost his financial position.

    "content": "A Sydney woman has revealed the drastic action she took to secure an apartment in Sydney and what made her say “oh my god”. The property market is tough, just ask Lindsey Fellows, who offered a 7-day settlement to starve off the competition. Ms Fellows, 55, is an office manager for the skincare and wellness brand, The Fountain of Youth and Lifestyle and spent three months trying to buy in the incredibly competitive Sydney property market. “I was sort of losing the will to live,” she joked. “I had previously gone for an apartment at auction, and that was horrendous, and I never wanted to do that again.” The most appalling aspect of the auction was that a one-bedroom apartment in South Sydney, priced at $750,000, ultimately sold for a staggering $951,000. One auction failure was enough for the office manager to find herself completely depressed by the Sydney property market, where the median price for an apartment is now $1 million. “What I found was real estate agents are different beings to the rest of us in the world. They always put the price guide really low,” she told news.com.au. She argued that you genuinely need to add on about $100,000 to every price guide you see listed in Sydney to get into the “right ballpark,” otherwise you’ll find yourself disappointed. When she found another apartment she liked in Alexandria with a price guide of $750,000 she was determined not to miss out. “The apartment was at a guide of like $750,000, and so I spoke to them, and I just said, ‘Look, I don’t want to go to auction again,” she said. The agent informed Ms Fellows that the owner would be open to offers, so she went in hard and offered $800,000 straightaway. “It was always going to go over $800,000, and I wasn’t going to go in too low,” she said. The offer wasn’t accepted straight away, and she was informed the vendor wanted to do a few open viewings first. After the weekend, she was contacted again and told that another woman had made an offer who wanted to buy the place for her son. Ms Fellows put in another offer of $820,000 to starve off the competition, but the other bidder than offered $850,000 and then things got tense. “I was like, ‘oh my god … here we go,” Ms Fellows said. Eventually she offered $880,000 and managed to outbid the competition, but then she was told a buyer’s agent offered $900,000 on a client’s behalf. “I just thought for the love of god,” she said. “The real estate agent said, ‘If you do want it, you need to give me your best offer’, and I said, ‘I have been giving you my best offers,” she said. Ms Fellows relented and put in an offer of $910,000, and to sweeten the deal, offered to do an earlier settlement. She remembered her mortgage broker had said they could easily get her mortgage sorted within 7 days, so she offered a 7-day settlement; in general, settlements typically go for 42 days. The agent then spoke to the vendor, who was so pleased with this 7-day settlement offer that the agent said it was enough for the vendor to “stick” with her offer and not accept any other offers, even if they were higher. Ms Fellows claimed she was told that if the vendor got “20 more offers”, he’d stick with hers because of the short settlement. So she agreed and then had to break the news to her conveyancer, who was “panicked,” and her mortgage broker, who was surprised but less stressed. Despite everyone’s initial freak-out, both her mortgage broker and conveyancer managed to get the whole thing “done and dusted” within five days. Ms Fellows explained that sometimes you have to think outside the box, especially when you’re at the “bottom end” of the market, where competition is fierce. “There’s so much competition, and I was buying as one person, and you’re up against couples who have that two-salary power,” she said. Ms Fellows’ mortgage broker, Craig McDonald, the owner of CBM Mortgages, said that he’d never had anyone request a 7-day settlement before. “The standard settlement is 42 days and you have clients asking if you can do 30 days. This was an exception when she asked me to do it in 7 days,” he told news.com.au. Mr McDonald said he is seeing people request quicker settlements “more than normal” because they’re trying to compete in the Sydney market. The mortgage broker explained that it was possible because Ms Fellows had “existing approval from a solid lender,” and so he was able to make it happen within a week. He said if any buyers want to use the offer of a shorter settlement to sweeten the deal, they need to make sure they have the “right lender” because some lenders just aren’t that fast. Mr McDonald said in general, there are just a lot more buyers on the market right now, which is “pushing prices up” thanks to a combination of rates holding and government schemes. Government staff in one Aussie state who are looking down the barrel of mass job cuts have been left fuming following a video call update. While Australia dodged the worst of America’s trade war, experts warn the fallout will still impact everything from mortgages to medicine costs. An extraordinary screaming match has erupted at a Sydney council meeting after a local member told his female colleague to “shut up when I’m talking”. Our Apps"

A high-flying real estate agent, who recently sold Mick Fanning’s home for more than $16 million, has been banned from one the country’s most exclusive restaurants for life. Troy Dowker, an agent with Michael Kollosche, is not allowed to enter Gold Coast restaurant Rick Shores “under any circumstances”. A source told news.com.au that the ban was likely to cause headaches for the agent, as the venue provides networking for the rich and famous. When contacted, Mr Dowker said: “Mate I’m just at a charity golf event, just in between holes, but mate I’ve got no comment on that, I’ll give you a call later today.” News.com.au never received another call and Mr Dowker has not replied to repeated attempts to reach him.

In a statement, Rick Shores said: “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual incidents or matters involving specific patrons.” News.com.au understands this is the first time Rick Shores co-owners David Flynn and Nick Woodward have ever banned a customer from one of their venues. An industry insider said the restaurant had been Mr Dowker’s “go-to” for wining and dining clients. Another source said it was his “regular fixture for years and he would take clients there, as well as his staff for Christmas, birthdays, and the Melbourne Cup”. They added the ban was a “huge blow to his ego”. Do you know more? Email harrison.christian@news.com.au The famous eatery on Burleigh Beach attracts many big names, including the likes of Chris Hemsworth, Miley Cyrus and Matt Damon. Since its founding in 2016, it has regularly been listed as one of the best restaurants in the country. Mr Dowker specialises in selling multimillion-dollar properties and is a major player in the Gold Coast real estate scene. In April, he sold champion surfer Mr Fanning’s property in Bilinga for more than $16 million in a pre-auction deal. The beachfront mansion known as “Rolling Seas” attracted interest from all over the world and set a new benchmark for the southern Gold Coast, Mr Dowker said at the time. Promotional material on his website boasts that he has made a total $1.5 billion in sales during his career. Last week Kollosche held its annual awards not at Rick Shores, but at the Tropic restaurant, which is next-door. Mr Dowker’s team took home a handful of gongs including salesperson of the year. The agency’s managing director, Michael Kollosche, said he had “no knowledge of any incident”. “Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for us to make any comment on Troy’s behalf,” Mr Kollosche said. “We do, however, wish to make it clear that there is nothing to suggest that this is a work or business-related incident.” Rick Shores owners Mr Flynn and Mr Woodward also own Norte and Sueno in Nobby Beach. Fresh holiday photos of all the Beckhams have incidentally exposed just how deep the alleged “feud” could be running. One of the alleged ringleaders of a “large-scale” loan fraud scheme has been arrested at Crown casino wearing a Louis Vuitton bomber jacket. “It’s funny thinking about how we used to hang out together and play together, and now we’ve won this together,” one of the winning mates said.

    "content": "A beloved boutique chocolate retailer is battling through a whopping rise in global cocoa prices, but Australia’s sweet tooth is helping out. A popular Aussie chocolatier is battling to “survive” amid a dramatic rise in cocoa prices, but Australia’s renowned sweet tooth might help it through the storm. Bruce and Joanne Nethercote, the owners of boutique Melbourne chocolate seller Chocilo, say they will raise prices on their products twice this year to match the wild upward swing in cocoa prices over the past two years. Cocoa is the main input ingredient in chocolate. “We’ve never had two price increases in a year, which we are doing this year,” Mr Nethercote told NewsWire this week. “It’s always been one (increase). For a small business, it’s always a little unnerving to put your product up a couple time of year, but we just have to or we won’t survive.” Supply shocks in northwest Africa, the prime growing zone for cocoa, sent prices soaring from around $US3000 a tonne at the beginning of 2023 to more than $US10,000 a tonne in 2024. “It’s settled down a little, but it will never go back,” Mr Nethercote said. “That has been the biggest direct impact on us.” Chocilo buys chocolate in bulk and then crafts it into its own boutique products, like a pinata-esque offering called a “chocolate smash cake”. The big dome of chocolate is filled with lollies inside and people smash it at parties like children hitting a pinata, Ms Nethercote said. Australia’s sweet tooth has helped the business chug along, even as cocoa, freight, labour and packaging costs all rise. “People still want to treat themselves,” Ms Nethercote said. “They probably don’t spend as much on themselves as they used to, but it’s a treat for the parents to come in with their kids and buy a little dinosaur chocolate, spend $5 or $6.” The small operators aren’t the only ones increasing prices in response to the cocoa tsunami. In its latest sales results from April, chocolate giant Nestle reported it had lifted prices 2.1 per cent to “address input cost inflation in coffee and cocoa-related categories”. “Despite the significant level of the increases in many markets, the actions were implemented with limited customer disruption,” the company said. Looking forward, the Nethercotes, both aged 57, said it was time for the business to “hunker down and consolidate”. “We’ve been quite lucky in some regards, but it’s been the right time at the right place with the right structure in place,” Mr Nethercote said. “We’ve still got growth. Our boutique Chocilo brand is still growing, from an online and wholesale perspective. We’re still increasing there. “It’s just the dynamics, or the type of product that the end consumer is really purchasing that has changed a little bit.” There are also some gathering tailwinds for Australia’s small businesses in the near term. “We expect the business outlook to improve as strong labour market conditions and lower interest rates encourage consumers to spend and in turn help businesses grow,” ANZ economist Adelaide Timbrell told NewsWire this week. Online grocery shoppers were hit with unexpected duplicate charges weeks after their Coles deliveries were completed, with the company apologising. A well-known Australian fashion chain has revealed it will fight a push to appoint liquidators after it was hit with legal action over alleged debts. End-of-financial-year sales and Australians flocking to one electrical item have triggered an unexpected retail boom. Our Apps"

    "content": "Government staff in one Aussie state who are looking down the barrel of mass job cuts have been left fuming following a video call update. NSW government workers facing the possibility of being jobless just before Christmas have been left with more questions than answers following an all-staff livestream meeting. Last week, Transport for NSW staff were informed via email that 950 Transport Senior Service Manager (TSSM) and Award positions would be cut, with the changes expected to be finalised by the end of 2025. Only office staff are in the firing line for these job cuts, with frontline roles exempt from the restructure. This is in addition to the previously announced reduction of 300 Senior Executive roles, more than 200 of which have already been delivered. In the email, Transport for NSW secretary Josh Murray said he knew the news would be “significant and concerning” for many people. The move is part of a bid to save $600 million in costs and “get back to a model that is sustainable long term”. On Friday, more than a week after the announcement, Mr Murray held an all-staff livestream in order to provide employees with more information and answer questions. “I know there are a lot of very specific questions as well as some general understanding that we want to dig into and we are dedicated to answering your questions and to have that conversation,” he said. Mr Murray said there was “no glossing over” the fact that Transport for NSW is facing significant cost pressures, claiming the organisation has been “living beyond our means” in recent years. Over the last five years an extra 3000 workers had been hired during and after the Covid period. Addressing the restructure, Mr Murray said a detailed branch design will commence this month, with the aim to have all Transport for NSW branches determined by the end of the year. However, it seems some of the 3500 staff who joined the livestream weren’t impressed with the secretary’s almost 40-minute long speech. One Transport for NSW employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told news.com.au that the explanations provided by Mr Murray made things “as clear as mud”. “(He) basically said a whole lot of nothing,” they said. The employee revealed that just two minutes was left for questions at the end of the livestream. Those leading the livestream ended up choosing just one question to answer from the many that were posted in the online forum, claiming many of the others had already been addressed. The question related to whether the 950 number would include “current fixed term labour hire positions that might be coming to an end”. In his response, Mr Murray said the “buckets” for labour hire or consultancies have “already been set targets”. Have you been impacted by job cuts? Share your story: alexandra.foster@news.com.au And, while they do intend to make further reductions in those areas, they have been “open” about the fact that it will be TSSM and Award roles that will be impacted. He added that, if during the process they discover areas where changes can be made that would make a real impact to the ongoing costs of the organisations, then “of course” it would be prioritised over the impacts to TSSM and award roles. News.com.au has been provided some of the questions posted by staff that were receiving the most ‘likes’ in Q&A forum during the stream. One employee pointed out the job cuts relating to senior executive staff were announced “well in advance” and have taken over a year to be implemented, with the process still ongoing. “In contrast the job cuts affecting TSSM and award roles were announced abruptly over email with very short notice and are expected to be completed by the end of December 2025,” they wrote. “Had we been given notice earlier we would have had sufficient time to explore better opportunities. How is this fair? Why weren’t we informed sooner?” The employee continued, stating staff had been asking for clarity for a long time but had been “repeatedly told and reassured that there would be no impact on award or TSSM”. “This sudden decision directly contradicts those assurances. It is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about transparency and communication and transport core values,” they wrote. Another person questioned why the initial announcement on the job cuts was circulated via email and not livestream, noting a lot of staff found out through the media. One employee questioned why Transport for NSW wasn’t using working from home as a way to save costs without losing staff. “WFH flexibility is a win-win for transport and its employees as it keeps the workforce happier which is more important than ever right now, but also reducing office cost. If ‘all avenues are being explored’, surely this is a priority,” they wrote. Another staff member asked for clarification whether fixed term contract roles would be included in the 950 figure. “We have been advised that fixed term employees are considered “out of scope“ but that contracts will not be extended beyond the end dates. This affects 1800 people,” they wrote, pointing out this suggests these job losses “are in addition to the 950 roles flagged”. At the end of the meeting, Mr Murray said all the questions would be addressed, with answers provided “through the Q&A process”. NSW Public Service Association (PSA) has slammed Transport for NSW over the latest job cuts announcement, claiming more cuts could instead be made to Senior Executive staff in order to spare other employees. “While TfNSW and the NSW Government crow that they have cut 200 Senior Executives already, the fact is there are still substantially more senior executives employed in Transport than any other Department,” the union said in a statement on Friday. “With over 1000 TSSE’s they have nearly three times the amount of senior executives within Health, despite having a quarter of Health’s workforce. “The PSA continues to call on the NSW Government to stop their protection racket for senior executives, have a look at their numbers again, and if they need to make $279 million in internal labour savings, continue reducing the size of their Senior Executives to avoid job cuts for Award staff.” Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said. While Australia dodged the worst of America’s trade war, experts warn the fallout will still impact everything from mortgages to medicine costs.

    "content": "Two hardworking Australians have revealed how they learned their life savings had vanished – and they’ll likely never see any of it again. Two Australians who lost almost $400,000 in retirement savings have revealed the toll the loss has taken on their health and livelihood. They are just a couple of the more than 6000 Australians unsure if they will ever see their money again following the collapse of First Guardian Master Fund. It’s been almost five years since Darwin resident Sam decided it was time to switch up his superannuation. Scrolling on social media in 2020, he was met with a post that asked him if he had “checked his super lately”. Intrigued and hoping to get a little bit more value out of his $250,000 in retirement funds, the 54-year-old chef and veteran decided to take the plunge and switch to another fund. “I wasn’t after anything astronomical, like a million dollars or something,” he told NewsWire. “I was just basically looking for something that’s going to work a little bit better than what I was having at the time.” That’s where his journey with First Guardian Master Fund began. About 6000 Australians have invested $590m into First Guardian, which was established in 2019 as a management investment scheme. Investors were advised to roll over their superannuation into a retail super fund, then invest their money into First Guardian. Sam asked his fund adviser to provide an update on his superannuation every six to 12 months. At first, Sam said things were “working really well”, with his $250,000 investment increasing to $330,000 over the span of a few years. However, he soon discovered “the whole lot” of his money had been transferred to Venture Egg Capital. Other customers said they were unaware their funds were being transferred to First Guardian Master Fund despite the details being written in the company’s legal documents. First Guardian Master Fund collapsed earlier this year, leaving thousands in the lurch and unsure if they will ever see their money again. In May 2024, Sam said Venture Egg informed him that his assets had been frozen, due to an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Alarms went off in Sam’s head after receiving a call from his fund manager a month later for his annual super check-in, who recommended he stay with the fund as it was “set up to make an earning potential”. The 54-year-old had invested $330,000 of his savings into the fund, and was now unable to access any of it. After his savings were frozen, Sam said his health went into a rapid decline. “I’ve been diagnosed with a rare vasculitis disease, so I’ve got to spend more time in hospital than I do at home,” he told NewsWire. Vasculitis is the swelling of the blood vessels, which can lead to organ and tissue damage. “I’m at the stage where I’d like to buy a house so I can retire in it,” he said. Sam said he has, instead, had to pick up part-time work as a chef to support himself, now he has nothing to fall back on. He has also been forced to rely to Centrelink for the first time since he was a teenager, and puts all his money into hospital visits, medication and everyday expenses. “I’m sort of a proud man,” he said, adding he was working in a “pretty high level management” position before his health deteriorated. “The knowledge knowing I will not have the retirement I would have liked makes me distraught for my future,” he said. The veteran, who said he had been in war zones for much of his early career, said his stress baseline had increased “four or five times”, and has no ideas if he will ever see his money again. “Here’s me who’s supported my country in more ways than one – and freedom for other countries too, fighting for them as well – and here I’m sitting on the bones of my back side sitting there wondering what I’m going to do and what I have to do to get my medication and make sure I get better,” he said. “I was in Afghanistan – I was all these war-torn areas and these people, they just take it from me.” Two years before First Guardian’s collapse, Victorian resident Lisa made the decision to move her savings into a different fund. With a few years left working as a registered nurse in San Remo, the 63-year-old was hoping to find a fund that would bolster the growth of her savings ahead of her retirement. “I was told my super would grow much faster by this ‘lead’,” she said. They instructed her to make an upfront payment of $4000 for her super to rollover, and was allocated a financial adviser from Financial Services Group Australia, who “was the one to work out what how to invest my superannuation according to the growth I wanted”. Then in April 2024, she got a call from her adviser, who told her “something happened with one of the companies”. She then learned $40,000 of her money had been invested into Shield Master Fund, which was subsequently frozen. It was then her financial adviser said “he didn’t know if I would get any (money) back”. After successfully getting in touch with her adviser after he “no longer (returned) my emails”, she discovered $20,000 of her savings had been transferred to First Guardian Master Fund. “I had no idea I had any money invested in (First Guardian),” she told NewsWire. “I had seen media coverage of this company’s liquidation. When I said this to the adviser, he had no response.” Half of Lisa’s retirement savings had allegedly been invested in two management funds which had since collapsed, and she had nowhere to go. “I have not been offered any kind of compensation or, in fact, heard from anyone involved in the set up of my super portfolio,” she told NewsWire. “I have now lost $60,000 – half my superannuation.” FTI Consulting liquidators Paul Harlond and Ross Blakely, who released their preliminary report into First Guardian, said they “intend to undertake further investigations”, including the determination “whether any breaches of the Corporations Act or any other laws have occurred by any party … or any other circumstances exist, which may give rise to a potential claim by investors”. In their report, the liquidators said they were “seeking compensation on behalf of members of the fund for losses suffered”, which could be as high as $446m. However, they also hold fears investors may never see their funds again. Their assessment found the “overall recoverable value of the investments is likely to be considerably less than their combined book value” and a “substantial shortfall of recoverable assets to outstanding investor funds will therefore likely arise in the liquidation”. In the report, the liquidators said “a large proportion of investors in the (First Guardian Master Fund) invested through investment platforms”, adding the recovered funds may not be as high as hoped. “ … the liquidators consider the value of the assets may have been overstated in the accounts,” the report read. “It is very likely that some of the funds’ assets/investments are not recoverable or will not recover their full ascribed value. Indeed, significant shortfalls to book values are expected.” An ASIC spokesman said its “first priority has been to preserve any remaining assets of the scheme so they can be recovered for investors”. “Following concerns raised by ASIC, the Federal Court appointed liquidators to Falcon Capital and ordered the wind-up of First Guardian and its related funds in April. The court also restrained David Anderson a director of Falcon from dealing with his assets and appointed a receiver to his personal property. “ASIC’s investigation suggests that potential consumers were called and referred to personal financial advice providers who advised consumers to roll their superannuation assets into a retail choice superannuation fund, and then to invest part or all of their superannuation into First Guardian. “While ASIC’s investigation is ongoing, the Federal Court has made interim travel restraint orders against Falcon Capital director David Anderson on ASIC’s application. “The Court also made interim orders freezing the assets of another Falcon director, Simon Selimaj and restraining his travel. Those orders are in place until 27 February 2026.” No charges have been laid. To those impacted, the spokesman said they “understand the circumstances surrounding First Guardian are distressing for those affected” and it was “one of ASIC’s priorities to investigate what has happened”. A financial expert has revealed the “dumb” way some Aussies analyse the strength of their super balances - and shared the foolproof way to retire with over $1m. Lawyers are investigating a potential class action lawsuit against two collapsed super funds, saying Aussies could lose more than $1bn in superannuation. An Australian super fund which boasts $360 billion in assets and has more than 3.4 million members is under fire. Our Apps"

    "published": "2025-08-01T05:02:46+00:00",
    "content": "What began with a large bamboo ring wrapped in brown paper and posted across the Pacific to an Australian war bride in the US launched what became one of the world’s greatest fads of the late 1950s – the hula hoop.But Joan Anderson, the parcel’s recipient and the woman who delivered the concept of the hoop to America, was left out of the loop – ignored by the toy company that sold more than 100m hula hoops before the fad was replaced.It was not until 2018 that Anderson, who died on 14 July aged 101, was credited for her role in introducing the hula hoop after her story was shared in the short documentary film Hula Girl.The film provided Anderson the opportunity to tell her side of a story that involved the thrill of innovation quickly followed by the ache of betrayal and the worth of a “gentleman’s handshake”.In 1956, while on a return visit to her home town of Sydney, Anderson noticed how many people were having fun with large bamboo hoops, wriggling them around their waists and shimmying their hips like Elvis Presley.“Everywhere I would go, everybody was giggling and carrying on and when I asked what was going on they said, ‘Oh, everyone’s doing the hoop’,” she said.The joy was contagious and upon her return to the US where she was living, she told her husband, Wayne, about it. He wanted to see one of these hoops, so Anderson’s mother posted one over and during a dinner party demonstration of the hoop, after a guest compared Anderson’s moves to those of a hula dancer, the name hula hoop was born.“There are so many stories about where the name came from, and they are all fictitious” Anderson said in the film. “This is the true story about it.”Realising its potential as a toy product, the Andersons contacted an associate of Wayne’s named Arthur “Spud” Melin, the founder of the Wham-O toy company, whose instincts they trusted. They met in the company’s parking lot.“There were no witnesses; just Spud, my husband and myself,” Anderson recalled. “We told him we’ve called it the hula hoop, and he thought that was a great name for it.”Melin was intrigued and, as he and Wayne shook hands, he assured the Andersons that if the hula hoop made money for him, it would make money for them too.By 1958, as the popularity of the hoops – now patented, plastic and produced by Wham-O – escalated and, with sales exceeding US$30m in two months, the Andersons’ phone calls remained unanswered, messages not returned.The only credit given to Joan Anderson was as the “friend from Australia” who had inspired Melin.“I think that bugged me more than anything,” Anderson said. “I was not a ‘friend’.”Joan Constance Manning was born in Sydney on 28 December 1923 to Claude and Ethel Manning. After leaving school at 14, she began modelling, with ambitions to become a film star. She was a diminutive figure, just over five feet tall, and was nicknamed the Pocket Venus.In December 1941, Joan was the cover girl of Pix magazine and was declared to be “a typical Australian holiday girl” whose war work included knitting socks and writing letters. She received a picture of herself from troops at Tobruk who wrote, “you make us forget Libya”.While swimming at Bondi beach in 1945, Joan was approached by US Army Air corps P-38 pilot Wayne Anderson, who did not make an impression until she saw him that night at a dance in his uniform. Four months later, they were married and, in early 1946, she joined hundreds of other war brides on their journey to America.In 1961, the Andersons filed a lawsuit against the Wham-O toy company and eventually settled with a small amount of compensation.“Why be angry with something you can’t change? The world isn’t fair but life goes on. I had a great life,” Joan Anderson said. “My husband lived to be 87 and we had 63 wonderful years together. Happiness is the best revenge.”She and Wayne had four children: Warren, Gary, Carl and Loralyn, three of whom survive her. Wayne died in 2007. Despite the hula hoop disappointment, the Anderson children all had hoops as they grew up.“It was never a big deal in our family. [My parents] went on with their lives. They knew they messed up with the business deal,” Loralyn Willis said.Somalian Australian circus artist Marawa, an inductee of the Guinness World Record Hall of Fame for her hooping prowess, met Anderson in 2018 and was struck by her grace over her lost business opportunity.“If I can be like Joan when I am 100 then I’ll be happy,” she said. “Meeting her made me realise I’ve made the right career choice for a long life.”Willis said her mother was “fun-loving, adventurous and willing to try anything”. She was ziplining, parasailing and boogie boarding with her grandchildren until her mid-90s.“Mom was pretty happy that she got the recognition in the end and that she was able to bring so much joy to people around the world,” she said. “How can you hula hoop without being happy?”"

    "content": "We live in a society that champions individualism, productivity and professional and financial success. At every turn we’re encouraged to do it all, which can make us worry that if we’re not being productive, what is our purpose?Across two years of research, including interviews with more than 60 perinatal health specialists and hundreds of mothers on the Australian Birth Stories podcast, we learned that most mothers enter postpartum with unrealistic expectations of themselves and their bodies. Some are left feeling purposeless and questioning their worth when the work of caring for a baby doesn’t fit with the narrative of a results-driven society.And so it’s helpful to flip the narrative and consider rest as the most productive thing you can do after birth. While pregnancy is the most ordinary of experiences, it is also absolutely extraordinary; it’s the longest, highest-energy expenditure task the human body performs.After that you deserve rest, you need rest and it’s important to remember that your body heals when it’s resting. In fact, making a full recovery from childbirth is dependent on rest. When you care for yourself in postpartum, you lay the foundation for your long-term health and wellbeing.When it comes to postpartum, especially if you’ve got older children, rest is only made possible through intention, preparation and support. There’s a lot of privilege associated with the opportunity to rest – access to a support network or the funds to pay for one – but it also requires you to value it and prioritise it. Understanding that there are different ways to rest, even when sleep is not something you can count on, can make that easier.1. Social restThis doesn’t mean cancelling all plans but rather considering how you feel in social situations and being aware of the effect people have on you. Social rest is choosing to spend time with people who support your intentions and bolster your energy, who fill your soul and make you feel good.Ultimately, you want your social interactions to be positive and meaningful rather than draining and obligatory. This is particularly pertinent in early postpartum when unwanted guests can become a hindrance, tiring you and your baby by overstaying their welcome, which will make you feel depleted and exhausted at an already overwhelming time.2. Mental restThe immediate period after birth is a mentally demanding phase of rapid learning. This focus and subsequent exhaustion is exacerbated by birth recovery, fogginess (often referred to as “baby brain”), sleep deprivation and learning to breastfeed (if you do so). It’s imperative to give your brain space to process what you’re learning so the lessons have time to sink in. To create this space be mindful of what else you’re consuming, especially advice from social media, as information overload can make it hard to be discerning.If you feel as though there are too many thoughts, ideas and questions in your head, write them down in a dot-point list: it helps you to find clarity and empties your head of distractions.3. Sensory restBecause you’re in a physiologically vulnerable and sensitive state, you want to be gentle with your whole self. Any stress, anxiety or concerns will rattle you more than they usually do. Calming music, warm baths, hot tea, cosy clothes and minimal screen time will help you stay grounded. Think of your postpartum bedroom and house as a cocoon; prepare it while you’re pregnant and you’ll really benefit from its comfort.You’ll also benefit from time alone where no one is touching you. Being “touched out” is a common experience in early motherhood and is particularly relevant if you have older children who can, understandably, need extra touch and reassurance. This may quickly feel sensorially overwhelming, so prioritising breaks – in the shower or bath, in your bedroom with the door closed – goes a long way to creating the physical space you need to feel settled.4. Physical restBeyond the passive physical rest of sleep, active rest such as lying horizontally as much as possible in the first few weeks after birth is a big step towards recovery. This allows your pelvic floor to heal from pregnancy and birth, which is important for your long-term health.Active rest also involves releasing obvious tension in your body. Moving your hips and legs in a way that feels good – yoga, massage – is recommended in postpartum to improve circulation. Likewise, performing gentle stretches of your upper body, neck and shoulders will release the tension you may experience while learning to breastfeed.If you’re breastfeeding, it can be really helpful to feed while lying on your side; this prevents your upper body from getting tense and won’t place unnecessary pressure on your pelvic floor and perineum. But if you’ve had a caesarean birth, lying on your side to feed can be painful for the first few weeks, so you may be more comfortable in a supported seated position.5. Emotional restTalking to your partner, birth support person or doula/midwife is important. We often have a lot to unpack after birth and it’s common to want to share how you felt in labour, the highs and lows of the experience, and how you feel now. This is really healthy: you’re letting go of your thoughts, processing them with empathetic listeners and considering how they make you feel. Emotional rest is the calm you feel when you can share your experience in an honest and authentic way. This is an edited extract from The Complete Guide to Postpartum (Murdoch Books; $39.99)"

    "content": "It was 1996 and I was in a nightclub in Tokyo. I was 26 and had been living and working in Japan for three years. I was dancing, along with my friends, to the thump of hypnotic house music. Next to me, an older Japanese man wearing glasses moved closer. Dressed in a dark blue suit, the attire of a “salaryman”, he looked out of place. He puffed on a cigarette as he tapped me on the shoulder. “You look like you can sing,” he shouted over the music. Why would he think that, I wondered. Because I am Black, something of a rarity in Japan? Did he also presume I had natural rhythm and could run a speedy 100-metre dash? I told him I taught English in a language school, but he pressed a crisp meishi (business card) into my hand and said: “I’m a talent scout for a music label and you look like you can sing. Call me.”I wasn’t sure that I could sing. Like most people, I was partial to belting out a show tune in the shower and, given that I lived in Japan, I sang at karaoke. I could hold a tune, but I was no Whitney. Still, I was curious, so I decided to call.A few months later, I was in a recording studio in Tokyo, clutching a microphone. Although I wrote the lyrics to the music, which was composed by a Canadian producer, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was out of my depth. My trip-hop debut landed in Tower Records’ flagship store in Shibuya in the summer of 1997. Despite the glamour of being able to secure a table in the city’s hottest restaurants, performing the odd gig and signing autographs (I recorded my CD under my Yoruba Nigerian middle name, Adebisi, rather than my first name), the adrenaline rush soon wore off and doubt crept in.My album wasn’t exactly lighting up the charts and the royalties were not flowing. I started to feel like an impostor. I met other singers in Tokyo who had slogged for years on the circuit hoping to catch a break. How could I call myself a singer? I had got there by luck: I was in the right place at the right time, but I wasn’t exceptionally talented.Little wonder my “singing career” was over before it started. In 1998, I returned to my day job teaching English and my producer found another singer, a woman with a voice like an angel.After five years of living in Tokyo, I felt it was time to return to the UK. I left for London in the winter of 1999, a couple of months before I hit 30. By 2011, I was living in rural Norfolk and, apart from my family and a few friends, no one knew about my moment in the spotlight. I held on to a cardboard box of Japanese memorabilia – the sole reminder of my previous life – but I was never tempted to listen to the album I had made; I felt embarrassed by it.Then, in the spring of 2022, I started writing my memoir, reflecting on aspects of my life that I had forgotten – or buried. For the first time in more than 25 years, I listened to my album, not once, but several times. I spent a rainy afternoon marvelling at the expressive freedom in my voice and began to wonder if I could find joy in singing again.I joined the Big Heart and Soul choir in Norfolk on a cold, drizzly night in January 2025. I slipped quietly into the hall, keeping on my hat and coat, and sat with a gaggle of women clutching song sheets. “Welcome to the sopranos,” one of them said, with a wry smile. “Join in when you feel ready,” said the person next to me.The emotion, depth and beauty of their singing brought tears to my eyes. Slowly, I began to join inI didn’t open my mouth. If I wanted to sing again, was it really as part of a rural community choir? I gripped my lyric sheet, biting my lip. Then, as I listened, the choir’s harmonies soared and the hairs on my forearms stood up. The emotion, depth and beauty of their singing brought tears to my eyes. Slowly, I began to join in, my voice tentative at first, then louder. I was no longer a lone voice singing into a microphone in a stuffy recording studio in Tokyo; I was part of a larger, collaborative sound. In that moment, decades of feeling like a fraud lifted. The harmonies we created were so jubilant and full of life that I sang with a permanent grin.When the class ended, one of the choir members asked if I had sung before. I paused before telling her the truth – about the stranger in the nightclub, the album in Tokyo and how I had lost confidence in my voice. “So, you were big in Japan,” she deadpanned. I smiled.After that, there was no stopping me. My singing voice was no longer hidden in a box of memorabilia; I sang whenever possible, belting out cheesy show tunes in the shower and singing along to my own record in the car. Now, if I hear a song I like, it doesn’t matter if I only vaguely know the words; I sing along anyway. Joining my local choir made me feel unbound, like a baby learning to walk, stumbling into a playground of endless vocal adventures. I may not be Whitney, but, really, who is?

    "content": "It was 2003 and the Peter Falconio case was fresh in our minds. As 22-year-olds itching for adventure, my wife and I, and one of our closest friends, nonetheless decided to fly from the UK to Australia and spend six months road-tripping through the outback.We were driving 250km from Julia Creek to Mount Isa in Queensland, in a Ford Econovan that had seen better days.About 50km short of the town, there was a loud bang beneath the van and the fuel level started dropping rapidly. A stone had pierced the rusty petrol tank and our petrol had drained on to the road – all of it except for the spare metal jerrycan that we’d kept for emergencies. The van quickly stopped running. But to our unbelievable good luck, we were only about 100 metres from a rest stop, to which we pushed the van in the baking morning heat.Parked in the rest stop was a new, high-spec camper van. With recent news headlines in mind, we were apprehensive about approaching a stranger in the middle of nowhere – we’d spooked ourselves out a couple of times already on the trip – but we didn’t have many options.We knocked on the door to be greeted by a barrel-chested Aussie halfway through having a shave. We asked for any suggestions as we were in dire straits.In another moment of unbelievable good luck, the man turned out to be a retired mechanic, who fixed the jerrycan to the engine. That held long enough for us to get the van to Mount Isa where he and his wife very kindly followed us – almost another three hours’ drive away – to make sure we didn’t get taken advantage of by the local mechanic.We bought the man, whose name was Pete, a pack of XXXX Gold beer to say thanks. I distinctly remember him downing one, opening a second, and downing that too. Pete and his wife told us they had kids who were travelling in England at the time and they would have wanted strangers to help them if they needed it.We got extremely lucky with Pete and his wife. If they hadn’t been there, we would have been very stuck without a clue what to do, on a blisteringly hot day. It made us vow to do the same if we were ever in a position to help.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?If you’re having trouble using the form click here.

How can I encourage it?Diagnosis Hoyas, often known as wax plants, have a reputation for thriving on “benign neglect”. They flower best when slightly stressed, as this triggers their reproductive mode. Regular watering and abundant nutrients will encourage leaf growth rather than blooms.Prescription Allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings – typically, every two to four weeks in autumn and winter, and more often in warmer months. Limit fertiliser applications, as hoyas flower better in nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure bright but indirect sunlight, as too much direct sunlight or a lack of darkness at night can disrupt their flowering cycle. Conversely, some people recommend “sun-stressing” their hoyas. Also, consider a slight drop in temperature overnight.Prevention Maintain a balance between attentive care and minimal interference. Aim for indirect lighting, cooler night-time temperatures, and less frequent feeding and watering. The mild stress should boost flowering potential.Got a plant dilemma?

    "content": "Newcastle is on Awabakal and Worimi country. It has changed dramatically since I moved back here from Sydney in 2008. The cityscape is full of cranes with lots of new apartment blocks and hotels. The light rail is a newish, if controversial, addition and great coffee is everywhere.A lot more tourists come here now. In her memoir The Taste of Memory, the late, great writer Marion Halligan described Newcastle as “that well-kept secret of a place”. Well, the secret’s out!It’s such an easy place to live; everything is a 15-minute drive away. In October, an international terminal is opening at Newcastle airport with a direct flight to Bali up first. Everyone’s hoping for a bigger Asian destination next, so we can link up with Europe. That will be a game-changer for Newcastle.FoodMy top pick is the French-inspired Bistro Penny. It opened in 2024 in a heritage building in the inner city and it has ambience galore. It’s quite expensive but the classic Cafe de Paris steak is hard to beat. Book in advance for a weekend table.Humbug makes its own pasta and has a super interesting wine list. In summer, I love to stroll up from Newcastle beach and eat outdoors. From snacks to mains, it’s all good. Nagisa is a Japanese restaurant in Honeysuckle, right on the harbour. The sashimi, wagyu beef and dumplings are excellent and the banquets are perfect for a group.I salivate just thinking about Arno Deli’s paninis. The warm porchetta is my favourite – wintry and earthy with eggplant. It does cold salami or prosciutto paninis, too, and the cannoli is great. It’s in the CBD; expect a queue on weekends.Equium Social in Mayfield is serious about coffee but does excellent hot chocolate, loose-leaf native ingredient tea, housemade sodas and smoothies too.Cakeboi in Hamilton is owned by Reece Hignell, a baker who was on MasterChef. It has Newcastle’s best hot chocolate and good chai but you go for the cakes. My favourites are raspberry coconut cake, devil’s food cake, lemon tart and cinnamon scrolls.Sunnyboy Kiosk at Dixon Park beach is super local. Everyone raves about the coffee but I get a smoothie or a fresh juice. You pull up a plastic stool in front of the surf club among Newcastle Knights rugby players and a young beachy crew in gym wear.NatureThe historic Newcastle ocean baths are free, spectacular, close to a light rail stop and wheelchair-accessible. The concrete bleachers are painted a shade of teal that just screams art deco. You get everyone from boisterous teenagers to Newcastle’s top barristers. Some days the tide smashes over the wall and you see cormorants, osprey, sea eagles or whales. On hot nights people come to sit around or swim, and there’s lighting for evening dips.Bathers Way is a popular 6km walk from Merewether ocean baths in the south to Nobbys beach in the north. Keep walking around the harbour and you’ll pass the waterfront precinct Honeysuckle and reach Throsby Creek in Wickham. It was once heavily polluted but now there’s silvery fish leaping about, birdlife, mangroves and Newcastle Rowing Club uses it for their annual regatta. It’s a rewilding success story that proves community can fight for a space and make it something special.Hickson Street lookout in Merewether has a stunning view. Young people hang out here, eating takeaway. You can walk down to Burwood beach (beware, it’s unpatrolled) or challenge yourself with a hike or a bike through the Glenrock state conservation area.Stockton Bight sand dunes, in Worimi conservation lands, are famous. Murrook Adventures runs an all-terrain vehicle sand dune tour packed with cultural and ecological insights. It’s so good, I’ve done it twice.NightlifeNewcastle’s live music scene has gone backwards over the decades. There aren’t many venues left, but The Lass pub has long been a live music hotspot and the Stag & Hunter hotel gets some amazing Australian and international acts. Mad Poet in Newcastle West is newer and has a great wine list, hotdogs and tacos, and a small stage for live acts on Wednesday nights.Like most places, it’s the small bars and breweries that are booming these days. Bar Mellow on Hunter Street is in a beautiful ex-bank. It has cool booths and a nice vibe; I’d go for a negroni or a good glass of wine. Method Brewing in Islington is close to heaps of great restaurants on Beaumont Street and you can BYO food to the brewery.Romberg’s is my pick for a sophisticated cocktail with a view. It’s on the top floor of Crystalbrook Kingsley but it’s open to all.InspirationThe Lock-Up contemporary gallery in Newcastle’s historical precinct runs exhibitions, performances and classes. It’s in an 1800s police station and there’s still a padded cell inside. A lot of the art is site specific and responds to Australia’s colonial history. The curation is top-notch and recent artists have included Khaled Sabsabi and Locust Jones.Murrook culture centre is an amazing newish First Nations-run space in Port Stephens (20 minutes north). It leans heavily into interactive digital media and video; it’s quite unique. You can pick up some local Gathang language phrases in the cafe, which serves yapay djagil (house food) close to a peaceful billabong fringed by paperbark trees.The lighthouse at Whibayganba/Nobbys Head is an iconic symbol of Newcastle. There’s a beautiful walk along the breakwall there. It’s currently managed as Lighthouse Arts by Hunters Writers’ Centre and it has exhibitions on the weekend. The 360-degree view from the top is spectacular.Newcastle Art Gallery in Cooks Hill is reopening in late September in tandem with New Annual arts festival. The exhibition space will be doubled plus it’ll have a new cafe and shop.NeighbourhoodEclectic Newcastle East is my favourite place. You’ve got million-dollar ocean view apartments as well as housing commission units right there on the water. There’s ocean baths, cafes, parklands, cool restaurants and lots of heritage buildings. It’s next to the CBD but is about 300m from Newcastle beach – that’s pretty rare!Newcastle beach is the last light rail stop. From there, I recommend heading to Grain Store, in a former warehouse, for one of its many boutique beers. Or getting takeaway oysters or fish and chips from Scottie’s and eating them on the grass.Islington and Wickham are pretty gentrified suburbs but maintain an egalitarian, low-key feel. Slingtown in Carrington roasts its own coffee, while Yard Sale in Islington is an ethically minded store with both wardrobe and pantry staples. I buy all my presents at High Swan Dive. It’s like a nursery for millennials with indoor plants, nice pots and gardening tools. Islington park has a skate bowl, a playground and access to Throsby Creek.Darby Street in Cooks Hill is Newcastle’s best-known eat street. It has inner-Sydney vibes, terrace housing and the Delaney hotel. Goldbergs coffee house has been operating since 1995 and is the only spot open for coffee after 3pm. It’s a no-frills institution. I’m one of the regulars who has been coming for 25 years.AccommodationThe newest kid on the block is Little National hotel (from $180) in Newcastle West. It’s closest to the Newcastle Interchange light rail stop if you’re on the train from Sydney. The rooms are tight but people rave about the beds.Rydges Newcastle (from $200) is a bit old-school but the rooms are spacious and it’s right on the harbour. The bulk carrier ships glide past your window blowing that distinctive horn, and the path to the start of Bathers Way is right out the front.Crystalbrook Kingsley (from $234 per night) is in a mushroom-shaped building that’s very architecturally arresting. It has Romberg’s rooftop bar, a great restaurant called Roundhouse and a casual bar downstairs called Ms Marys. It’s close to the Darby Street precinct.It’s a five-minute ferry to Stockton Beach holiday park (from $38 for an unpowered tent site and $214 for a villa) or a good swimmer could make their own way. It’s alongside Stockton Bight sand dunes. Rosemarie Milsom is the founding director of Newcastle writers’ festival"

    "content": "You need a break. It is very important, from time to time, to take a break from your partner, from your work, from your children, from your exercise, from your screens, from alcohol and drugs and therapy and podcasts and crisps. We need time and space to rest; this is a crucial part of a better life. This much is obvious.But we need to take breaks for less obvious reasons too.As any patient of psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis knows, come July, therapists are banging on about their August break. You tell them a dream about losing your child in the supermarket; they interpret this as you feeling like a lost child because of the break. You talk about feeling angry at a friend who cancelled plans; they suggest you are feeling angry and abandoned because of the break. It’s outrageous and ridiculous – and most of the time, in my experience, absolutely true.I know this because I have fought off many of these kinds of interpretations over the years as a patient – and I still do sometimes. And I always try to understand the unconscious impact of my break as a therapist on my patients; because I know it cuts deep. Feeling left, excluded, disappointed, unwanted – nobody wants these emotions, but if you want to build a better life, you need to feel them, so they can find a home in your mind. Otherwise, this unwanted part of you ends up feeling abandoned and excluded twice over, and the emotions get locked down and stuck instead of understood and felt. When therapy is unboundaried and without breaks, the patient is robbed of this opportunity to grow.Over time, my daughter has thrived in her sense of separateness, in learning new things without meThe break is part of the treatment. Deeper change is made possible by the therapist’s absence and the patient’s survival of it. It hurts – but at least we don’t have to pay for that part.This is true of all relationships in life: separation is a prerequisite to growth. This came alive for me when I took my daughter to nursery for the first time. The pain and anxiety of leaving her felt almost unbearable for both of us – and that “almost” is important. Actually, it was bearable, after a settling-in period in which she could begin to feel safe in the nursery in my presence, and grow the capacity to tolerate my absence for longer and longer periods. Thanks to her keyworker’s sensitivity, understanding, care and hugs (for both of us), it was difficult and painful, but not a trauma. And, over time, my daughter has thrived in her sense of separateness, in having grown through a difficult experience, and in learning new things without me. In beginning to build her own life.For both our sakes, I had to let her go and learn to take breaks. Not only because I needed to rest. I also had to understand something about myself, which I think lies at the heart of a struggle that many of us experience. We don’t want to believe the fact that we are not indispensable, that our loved ones can survive without us, that they can manage. The conviction of the necessity of our constant availability is so compelling, we don’t believe life can go on when we aren’t there. And that makes sense; that’s how it often is at the beginning. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott said: “There is no such thing as a baby” – meaning, the baby simply cannot exist in the absence of maternal care (not only, but usually, provided by the mother).But as time goes on, and as babies grow up, separation has to become possible, and a child has to come to exist in the absence of the mother. And the same is true of friendships and romantic relationships. Nothing kills a friendship or sex life like long-term and unflinching dependence on one another with no time apart.For some, there are practicalities that make a break impossible. Parents and carers with children with disabilities who need additional care, for example, can struggle to secure the right kind of support that might make it possible for them to take a break of any kind. But the absolute necessity of these breaks is recognised in law (by the Children Act 1989 and the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011). So while I do understand that of course there may be external reasons why someone may not be able to take a break, that may make it even more important to find a way to do so.External reasons are probably not the only thing stopping us. The belief in the necessity of our constant presence protects us, unconsciously, from our awareness of our own limitations, of our vulnerabilities and needs. It protects us from the experience I had recently, of putting my daughter to bed earlier than usual and thinking, “What am I going to do with myself now?” and not knowing the answer. It can protect us from an empty feeling of not knowing ourselves, that we’ve been unconsciously filling up with all sorts of obligations and duties, which take us further away from what we truly need.So sometimes, in the interests of building a better life for you and your loved ones, taking a break really is the most important work you can do.That’s my story, and I’m sticking with it.

    "title": "I spent my childhood in and out of hospital. At 19, I finally realised I had a terminal disease",
    "author": "Paula Cocozza",

    "content": "Yvonne Hughes was 19, and attending the funeral of a friend with cystic fibrosis, when she realised: “Oh shit, I’m going to die of this.” She had met him during shared hospital stays in childhood, and although Hughes had always known she had CF, she had never understood her illness as terminal until that day in 1992, when she stood at the back of the crowded chapel in Glasgow. For three days afterwards, she couldn’t stop crying. “I had a kind of meltdown. That’s probably the first time I thought that this thing I had was going to kill me.”Over the next few months, Hughes, who was studying at the University of Glasgow, listened to her mum, dad and older sister chatting during family meals as if she was a ghost at the table. “I pulled back from them. I deliberately didn’t talk or include myself,” she says. “I wanted them to get used to sitting and chatting without me, so that when I died, they wouldn’t notice I wasn’t there.”It’s a harrowing responsibility for a teenager to take, but self-erasure must have felt like a way to pre-empt death, perhaps to resist it. When she was growing up, cystic fibrosis was considered “a childhood disease” – because about half of those diagnosed did not survive their teens. A genetic condition in which the body creates thick, sticky mucus, it makes digestion difficult, damages lung function and can lead to respiratory failure. It affects about 160,000 people globally.Now 52, and enjoying what she calls a “second chance” at life more than 30 years later, Hughes has emerged as a comedian. We are speaking on a video call before her one-hour show, Absolutely Riddled, which she is performing at the Edinburgh fringe, based on her experiences of living with the condition. “I want to be true to myself and my story,” she says. Why does she think she survived when so many didn’t?For most of her childhood, Hughes, who works as a community development worker in Renfrewshire, didn’t regard herself as struggling for survival. Her parents didn’t sit her down in childhood to explain her illness; she had been diagnosed at six weeks old. But there were hospital visits and tablets and eating often made her vomit. Gradually, she says, she “put together those two words, cystic and fibrosis, with something that I had”.At school, she kept her illness hidden, taking her medication at home. She was popular; joined the Brownies, then Guides. “I’m a very level-headed person, but I keep a lot in my mind. I remember when I was younger thinking: ‘There’s no point telling people about this because everyone is dealing with something. I’m nothing special.’ I just got on with it.”Roughly one in every 2,500 people are born with cystic fibrosis in the UK, Australia and the US. Hughes’s older sister does not have the illness and the family had no idea what it meant for their lives, or for Hughes herself.Only as she grew older did Hughes build a sense of the precariousness of her life. “My mum said to me: ‘We thought you were going to die, every day. We just didn’t know.’ It became their new normal to keep me alive.”If she got a chest infection, pleurisy or pneumonia, she would go into hospital, and over the years made friends on the CF ward, a fragile community. When the curtains were closed around a bed for a long time, Hughes and the other children knew not to go past. She reasoned with herself, to allay her fears: “People were dying around me but I put it down to: ‘Maybe they had a really bad infection, maybe they were worse than me.’” In childhood, she developed “a lot of level-headed thought processes around why those people died”.She found solace in the Cystic Fibrosis Trust magazine, and dreamed of attending one of the advertised camps. “Luckily, I didn’t,” she says, because in the early 1990s, scientists discovered that the camps were a hotbed for the spread of bacteria, present in the lungs and phlegm of children with CF. Many cross-infected each other, some with fatal consequences.Did Hughes struggle to accept that sense of herself, as both vulnerable and a threat? “Absolutely,” she says. Hospitals implemented a policy of segregation, according to bacteria carried. Hughes has the pseudomonas bacteria, and after her friend’s funeral in 1992, she stopped seeing people with cystic fibrosis in case they had different bacteria or bugs that might lead to cross-infection.She has stayed in touch by phone with one old friend. “We shared growing up in the hospital ward and I do love speaking to him.” But after that funeral, “I became reckless,” she says. “I thought: ‘Well, life’s for living. I’m just going to do what I want.’ I didn’t care very much for myself. I thought: ‘What’s the point?’ I spiralled.”Her 20s and 30s passed in a blur of “festivals, partying, travelling when I could, flying by the seat of my pants … ” She had hoped to meet someone, and to have children. “I thought it would happen. And it never did.” In her 30s, her lung function got so low – 45%, then 36% – that she wouldn’t have been able to sustain a pregnancy anyway. “That was something I tried to grieve. But over the course of a year, I thought: ‘I’d rather be alive.’ My mantra became: ‘I’d rather have a full and short life than a long and unhappy one.’ These kinds of philosophical things got me through.”Hughes doesn’t have a mantra now – “other than trying to be funny”. The frequency of her performances range from three times a week to every few weeks, depending on her health needs. But even in her reckless phase, she embodied a stoicism, too. She worked throughout – at a call centre, a radio station, the CF Trust. “I just had to keep going, pay my bills and mortgage.”Did she ever wonder: “Why me?” She has had years of spitting out and swallowing mucus – “constant, constant” – hankies everywhere, non-stop sterilising of stuff, endless medication and pain, unable to take the next breath for granted. As a child, when she went into hospital, there was a faint sense of privilege at being given Lucozade and new slippers, things her sister didn’t get. But no one else in her family has the illness. Didn’t she feel aggrieved?“It’s a difficult question,” she says. “I’ve thought about ‘Why me?’ in a positive sense – that it was me because I could handle it. Or, I’m glad … because this has made me the way I am.” She has also thought, “Why at all? Why did cystic fibrosis come into being? Why have this weird disease that just kind of ruins lives?”While Hughes survived childhood by reminding herself that she wasn’t special, the differences between her life and others’ sharpened as she entered her 40s. She became an aunt, and bore close witness to her peers’ life transitions while she kept on being “just Yvonne – the one that never reached any potential”.“I couldn’t have a career because I would always get ill. I never moved social class. I always remained working class.” Her dad was a welder, her mother a GP receptionist. “Everything I did, I did myself. But it was day by day, week by week. There was never a plan. I always felt I could never get ahead of myself.”In 2018, aged 45, with deteriorating health, Hughes took redundancy from her job as public affairs officer at the CF Trust. Eating was difficult. Her weight hovered around 7 stone. She braced herself for the possibility of a lung transplant, but as her lung capacity dropped to 30%, she was deemed too ill for the waiting list. “I was like: ‘OK, that door’s closed. At this point, there isn’t anything else on the horizon to keep me alive.’” She completed an end-of-life form, and met the palliative care team. She thought: “I’ll see my days out with my parents, make memories and know I did well to get to 48.”Then, in 2020, the UK government granted access to a new drug, Kaftrio. Hughes had read about its worldwide trials. When the delivery driver knocked on the door, she told him: “You’re going to save my life.” At that point, her lung function was down to 26%.Within an hour or two of the first tablet, she started coughing. “They call it the purge,” she says. There was so much mucus – dark, watery and horribly fascinating – she captured it in a cup, put a lid on it, and stowed it in a drawer in her bedroom. “I kept that cup for a long time,” she says. Maybe she already knew it was a relic.The Kaftrio turned Hughes’s life “a whole 180, literally overnight”. There are side-effects – insomnia, weight gain, which have brought other challenges – but before long, she says, “I could breathe again without coughing. I went back to work within the year. I could run, I could dance, I could speak, I could stand up straight and cook. I used to always be bent over, catching my breath. And then all of a sudden that was gone. It was a miracle.”Energised, she decided to enrol in an evening course. Acrylic painting, maybe, or playing the keyboard? But at the University of Strathclyde’s Centre for Lifelong Learning, it was the flyer for comedy that caught her eye. “I had always loved going to gigs. Something clicked and I enrolled.”She performed a five-minute set for the course finale – and immediately wanted to do it again. “I started applying for clubs, Monkey Barrel and the Stand Comedy Club [both in Edinburgh]. I got Red Raw [the Stand’s beginners’ slot] and went from there. I want to change my life,” she says, “and I am doing comedy to see if I can change my life.”Nearly four years ago, Hughes met her partner, Alan, online. Having spent a lifetime feeling unable “to rely on a future”, she has had to learn to picture one – and to override her old instinct to absent herself to mitigate later losses. Sometimes, this means catching herself in the act of “pulling back” from Alan, and letting the pleasure she takes in his company teach her to quiet her mind.Life now is so different, it requires a conscious effort to remember how hard it was from one moment to the next. “I used to breathe so shallowly that I had to take a – haa! – sharp intake of breath – to feel I was breathing,” she says. The sound punctuated even the simplest actions – after getting into a car, for instance, after reaching for her seatbelt, after pulling it across her, after fastening it.“Now I can get in the car, pull the seatbelt over and go. I can walk and talk. I can laugh without wetting myself or going into a convulsion of coughing, pulling a muscle or breaking a rib,” she says. “It is a horrible, horrible disease. It suffocates you. It takes every inch of your breath away. And now it is something I can live with and not die from. I’ll probably live to get my pension.”Comedy has brought “fun, joy and laughter” back into Hughes’s life. But it has also given her something that nothing else has. “I had never found anything for me in my life. I’d never married. I had no children. So I had no community. Nothing,” she says. “There were people getting their careers and their lives sorted. Comedy was the one thing that was for me. And it still is. Just for me.” Yvonne Hughes: Absolutely Riddled is at Snug at Gilded Balloon Patter House, Edinburgh, until 15 August"

    "content": "One morning in 2018, my husband Reuben told me about a nightmare he’d had the previous night. He’d been driving over the Hewitt Avenue Trestle, a bridge near our house in Everett, Washington in the US, crashed through the barriers into the estuary below, and had to decide which of our two children to save.Two weeks later, I was getting Talia, then three, and Weston, 10 months, dressed, fed and out of the door to take them to preschool on my way to work.It was a route we’d taken a hundred times before. I was chatting to Reuben on speakerphone with both children in the back, when I smelled something odd, like plastic melting.I mentioned it to Reuben, but neither of us thought anything of it. There are industrial buildings nearby, so I assumed it was coming from one of them.A minute later, and no longer on the phone, I drove on to the bridge my husband had dreamed about, which was busy with rush-hour traffic. That’s when I saw the word “STOP” flash across my dashboard.Before I even had the chance to register it, I saw smoke rising from the bonnet of the car. I knew I needed to pull over, but the bridge, which is 2.5 miles long, didn’t have a hard shoulder. I decided it was safest to get across it and then stop the car.The smoke coming out of the bonnet was so thick I couldn’t see the road ahead. I pulled over and acted on pure instinctGripping the steering wheel, I put my foot down, but within seconds the smoke was so thick I could no longer see the road ahead. With cars flying past me, I managed to pull over to the side of the road.At this point, I was really distressed. I called the American Automobile Association (AAA), but, as if my luck wasn’t bad enough, my membership had expired. As I was talking to the operator, I saw flames through the windshield – the bonnet was on fire.Terrified, and certain the car was about to explode, I yelled that my car was on fire. Acting on pure instinct, I jumped out, opened the door behind me, and unclipped Weston’s car seat.I could hear the woman from the AAA shouting at me to call 911 as cars and lorries thundered past, just inches away. For a split second I froze. Was it safe to put Weston down on the road while I grabbed Talia? Could I run to the end of the bridge with them both in my arms?Just then, as I was almost overwhelmed with fear, an arm appeared. I looked up into the face of a man who said, “It’s OK, mama”, took Weston from my hands and went to his car, which was just behind me.I dashed round to Talia’s door, opening it to see flames inside, and spreading fast. She looked at me in terror and screamed, “Mummy!” Within a second, I had her in my arms, running back to the man’s car. As we zoomed off, I looked over my shoulder and saw flames shooting into the sky. Talia was sobbing into my chest.Unable to think clearly, I didn’t call 911 or Reuben, I just asked for us to be dropped at a nearby car dealership. I thanked my heroic rescuer and hugged him goodbye, only later realising that I didn’t even get his name.Reuben’s work was about 50 miles away, so I called a friend nearby, who immediately came to get us. He’s a funny guy, and, as I fell into his arms, weeping, he quipped: “Sorry I’m late. There was some big fire on the road.”I called Reuben on the way to my parents’ house. He was devastated, repeatedly apologising for not knowing the smell was something serious. I tried to reassure him: I hadn’t known, either.Seeing the burnt-out car arrive later that day before it was scrapped was awful. I felt sick at the thought of what might have happened if I hadn’t got the children out when I did.While Weston appeared unaffected throughout, and Talia was back to her happy self within hours, I struggled. I had awful dreams where I endlessly relived it. When driving our new car, I’d obsessively open the windows at the slightest smell, convinced it was on fire.A session of EMDR [eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing] therapy helped a lot. I was even able to drive across the Trestle and stay calm.We never found out what caused the fire. Thankfully, the children have no memory of that day now. And when they moan that Mummy doesn’t do this or that, I remind them that I entered a burning car for them – and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.

    "author": "Emma Joyce",

    "content": "Chantal Maher, a physiotherapy lecturer in Sydney, has a niggling life admin task on her mental to-do list. It has been on her mind for four years. “I’ve tried to do it twice, but because I got married and changed my name I had to do a change-of-name certificate. That delayed it further. It was like a whole other hurdle,” she says.The task is combining her two superannuation (pension) accounts, so that she only pays one admin fee. “It’s too annoying. There’s incentive as I’d save money, but finding time for it is another thing.”Mia Northrop, co-author of Life Admin Hacks, has encountered countless situations like this. She says people can get “stuck” in different stages of completing a task. “You might be really good at starting and really bad at finishing,” she says, or vice versa. “So you need to know this about yourself so that you can overcome the challenge.”When people struggle with admin, such as tax returns or creating a will, it can stem from fear of failure, Northrop says. “It’s tedious. It’s repetitive. It is often asking us to work on things that we are not particularly good at or confident about. That’s where a lot of procrastination can come into it because we aren’t particularly proficient, or we’re not passionate about it.”“Everyone procrastinates to some extent,” says clinical psychologist Dr Catherine Houlihan, from the University of the Sunshine Coast. “There’s a bit of stigma around it, because many people say it’s laziness or poor time management, and none of those things are true. It is actually a symptom of perfectionism.“When people have very high standards for themselves, and they worry about doing things perfectly … then, due to the standard not being met, guilt and shame and self-detrimental talk can come in.”  for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning There’s another reason Maher has put off her task – it seems harder than it needs to be. “I feel frustrated because I think [the companies] could make my life easier,” she says. “Part of me wonders if they make it deliberately awkward so we don’t do it.”Certain life admin tasks are irritating because you may only encounter them once. Associate Prof Micah Goldwater, a cognitive scientist at the University of Sydney, says we have to invest a lot of mental effort in learning new tasks. Then when we’re done, it “feels like there is very little use for it”.“With online forms there’s an initial block because … you’re having to learn how to use the specific form,” he says. “The functionality of all these forms is slightly different, and you have to be very detail-oriented and focused to work it out. Sometimes it seems like the trade-off isn’t worth it.”So what can a life-admin avoider do to tick off tedious tasks?Break it down into easier stepsNorthrop says she can’t get passionate about doing her tax return, so she created a checklist for herself – she ticks off sub-tasks throughout the year. “I have a folder where I save everything as I go so that when it comes to tax time, it’s not overwhelming.”Bribe yourselfHoulihan suggests incorporating rewards as you complete each stage. “Do one thing first and then pause and do something more enjoyable, have a break and go back to it,” she says. When Houlihan tackles an unpleasant task, she will break for “a pastry at a cafe, spending time in nature or watching the TV show I wanted to watch … a reward can help motivate us”.Find a buddyTelling other people what you plan to do can be helpful, says Northrop, but Houlihan says it can be controversial too. “You don’t want people to nag you,” Houlihan says. “That might give the tasks even more negative connotations” – which reinforces procrastination. “But if you say to someone that loves and cares about you ‘I want to do this by Friday’, it can help you hold yourself accountable.”The worse you feel about your ability to do a task, the less likely you’ll be to attempt it, and then the worse you’ll feel for not doing it. So choose your people wisely: “Not someone who is going to be on your back, or going to make you feel bad if you don’t do it.”Block out time“If there’s a task I have to do, rather than being on a vague to-do list, I put it into my calendar,” Goldwater says. Blocking off time in your day means it’s more likely to happen, he says. “Everything is in my calendar now. If it’s not on the calendar, I will most likely forget about it. Life admin tasks are one of those things.”Host a ‘forcing party’Combining accountability buddies with blocking out time, writer and educator Tyler Alterman found a novel way to beat procrastination. On X, he posted that throwing a “forcing party”, where he and his friends got together to do life admin they’d been avoiding, was a huge success. “A passport has been filed for, an inbox has been zero’d, a personal website has been created, & more,” he wrote.Create a calm spaceIf your environment is working against you, it might help to remove some of that friction, Northrop says. “Shut down distractions, turn off notifications, or listen to music that gets you in that flow state.”If you’re neurodivergent, “it’s extra challenging”, she adds. “There’s no silver bullet. It’s often a mixture of the physical environment and our own personality … I’ve had clients who have multiple children or health issues they’re having to accommodate, and there are only so many hours in the day.”Do the worst part first“If boring tasks sit at the end of your day or the end of your week, they’re probably looming in the back of your mind,” Houlihan says. “The anticipation of how unpleasant it will be grows and grows.“One quick tip is to flip your calendar upside down – start with the most boring things first and to get them out of the way.”Call in an expertSome life admin is incredibly convoluted and taxing. At this point, it’s worth considering engaging someone to help you navigate it, such as a social worker or solicitor.Ines Jusufspahic is an immigration lawyer in Sydney who works with individuals and companies to complete working visas and partner visas. “We take the angst out of it as much as possible,” the principal solicitor at Rocket & Ash Immigration Law says.Jusufspahic has had clients return to Brazil, Argentina and the UK: they had avoided the paperwork for so long, there wasn’t enough time to process their visas. “This is often the biggest problem in their life, and there’s often a time pressure,” she says. “It’s a process that people really dislike, and it’s really confusing for some people.”Houlihan says some people are chronic procrastinators, and the first step is recognising any patterns in your behaviour. “If you’ve still got that piece of paper on your table, then is that the only thing that’s still lying around?” she says. If it’s a widespread issue, and causing negative thoughts, a therapist can help you identify and work through the possible emotional triggers and understand why. “That’s really the key to what to do about it.”Do it later“I think we are often just being too hard on ourselves,” Houlihan says. “We can become trapped in a cycle of heightened stimulation and being on the go, especially if you have young children, and we can have this sense of urgency that we just apply to all tasks.“Actually take stock and think ‘Do I need to do this now?’”Houlihan has put off renewing her passport, as it’s not due for months. So she simply took it off her to-do list for now. “Because I could just do with one less thing at the moment.”Opting to take time for yourself instead can be an act of self-care, she says. Maher agrees: “If my choice is to go for a run, read a book, see a friend or do life admin, I’m gonna choose the other three things every single day of the week.”"

    "content": "I was very clear about wanting a family early in our relationship, but after two and a half years together my partner has admitted he doesn’t want kids. This is the best relationship I’ve had – he’s kind, patient, supportive, and we have the best sex. We’re both anxious people with avoidance issues, but I felt safe and cherished until last year, when I discovered he had cheated. He said it was an attempt to “escape”. I was deeply shocked. I ended the relationship, but he begged for another chance and accepted an ultimatum: commit to living together, getting a dog and starting a family (things I told him I wanted early on). He agreed to the first two, but said he needed more time for the last.I am 38 and asked repeatedly for honesty about children, fearing the same heartbreak I felt with my ex‑husband. Yet he kept it ambiguous, only to finally admit that he doesn’t want children but is afraid to lose me. I respect that it’s his decision, but I’m hurt and angry about being misled.I am a touring artist, which makes starting a family challenging, and it feels impossible to do it alone. I fear that if I can’t make music – vital for my emotional and financial wellbeing – I may succumb to the depression and repeat the grim fate of my parents.After years of dating, I can’t seem to find anyone I have much in common with who wants a family. The thought of ending up alone and childless terrifies me. I am trying to think of an alternative solution but, if I’m being honest, anything other than having a family with the person you love and who loves you back feels like a compromise.I’m so sorry you’ve been lied to. I feel that your inner voice has been screaming at you, but somewhere along the line you’ve learned to reason away your feelings. This man doesn’t sound like he’s the one for you. He has lied and he has cheated and you deserve better than to be scrambling around the “good bits” to somehow convince yourself that you need to make this work. You don’t.When you are in a situation that feels stuck, it’s impossible to imagine solutions, or a life better lived. I consulted relationship therapist Joanna Harrison, who said: “I can see that wherever you look it feels like there’s mourning to do [for your parents’ depression, your ex-marriage, your current situation]. You sound like someone who battles on alone, and perhaps this was essential with parents who were depressed.”One study showed that when couples had a baby despite a strong difference of views, they all separated by the time their first child went to schoolI wonder whether you could seek some therapy to tease out the threads of your past life with someone who is “on your side”, and to explore the loops that keep repeating. Both Harrison and I also wondered if your current relationship only seemed “kind and supportive” compared with past ones. If so, there are other kinder, more supportive relationships you may yet strive for.Harrison added: “One longitudinal study of parents showed that in a sample of couples who had a baby when there had been a strong difference of views about having a baby, in all cases the couples had separated by the time their first child went to primary school. It’s very painful for couples to be faced with a situation where there is no compromise, and it is very upsetting to lose the relationship and have to make this decision.”But I’d add that it would be easier in the long run than an unsatisfactory compromise. Also, why should you alone compromise? That would eat away at you in a different way. As your inner voice is saying: you need to try.You may well meet the right person for you. In the meantime, you said in your longer letter that you were open to alternatives, such as co-parenting, or a less nuclear-family option. “It feels that it would be unkind to yourself to not at least explore these options,” says Harrison. “It may not be what you choose, but it may be helpful to explore what these different ways of doing things would mean to you.”You may also find this Guardian article of interest, as well as my podcasts on Should I Have a Baby? and Hope and Loss.

    "content": "The prosecution: Leanne It looks like a drip and reminds me of a hospital. If he needs a drink, a cup is more appropriate I’ve been with my boyfriend, Wes, for about a year and a half. We don’t live together, and last summer he built himself a four-poster bed, which I thought was really cool. But a few months ago he got one of those water bladders with a long tube and hung it from one side of the bed.He said it was practical, and at first I didn’t mind. I thought it was a joke. There were also moments when I thought it was practical too. Sometimes, when he was drinking from it, I thought: “I’ll have a drink from it as well.” But then I asked him if he was going to take it down, and he just brushed it off.One day, we were having an intimate moment and he whipped out the water bladder and started drinking from it. He should have been concentrating on me so I was annoyed, and now it’s banished.Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. That’s acceptable – but it’s not for the bedroomIt was just a huge turnoff. It looks like a drip and it reminds me of a hospital. When you’re with your partner that’s not the connotation you want. Hydration is important, but if Wes needs a drink during sex a water bottle or a cup of water is more appropriate.The water bladder was up for about two and a half months in total. That moment tipped me over the edge, and thankfully Wes listened to me.We have come to an agreement to keep it out of the bedroom, but I know that part of him wants it back. We are going to a festival this weekend and Wes says he is going to bring two water bladders. I won’t be drinking from one unless there’s an emergency.Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. I think that’s acceptable as it’s what it was originally designed for – but it’s not for the bedroom.Even though we live separately, as I usually go to Wes’s place, I think he should listen to me when I say I’m not comfortable with something. He did take it down after that incident, but I know if I allowed it, the water bladder would go straight back up.The defence: Wes I get that it was maybe insensitive to do it during sex, but I didn’t expect her to be so bothered After building myself a four-poster bed while I was bored, I attached a water bladder I had lying around the house with a little bit of string, looping it over the top of the bed. I thought it was practical and funny. It was really hot recently, so it was a good way to stay hydrated.At first, Leanne drank from it with me when she came round to stay. She didn’t seem opposed to it. But then when I drank from it during an intimate moment she reacted really strongly. Things came to an abrupt halt there and then, and the water bladder was removed immediately. It felt like an overreaction in the face of something I thought was totally innocent. I get that it was bad timing and maybe a bit insensitive to do it during sex. However, I didn’t expect her to be so bothered.We are going to a festival soon and she’s banned me from using it in the tent tooIt started out as “look at this fun idea”, and I thought: “Wow, I can drink hands-free.” But then Leanne said she didn’t like the imagery of it. I do get that the thought of me lying in bed with a tube stuck out of my mouth during sex isn’t very attractive.But we are going to a festival soon and she’s banned it in the tent too. She’s OK with me using it when we’re out and about, just not when I’m lying down inside the tent. I think it’s much more practical than a cup – there’s no risk of spillage. And surely a water bladder is appropriate in any context where you’re camping?If we are in the crowds for hours and Leanne runs out of water, and I’ve got litres left in the bladder, I think she’ll end up using it. It’s a different context to the bedroom, but it seems like the whole idea of the water bladder is totally corrupted for Leanne now.There’s not really a middle ground for her when it comes to the water bladder. I’ve suggested getting a smaller one, but to no avail. Ultimately, Leanne’s upset is more important than the convenience. If it means she is happier, then it’s worth it, but privately I think a water bladder is entirely functional. If she said I could hang it off the bed again, I 100% would.The jury of Guardian readersIs a water bladder acceptable in the bedroom?Water bladders have their place, but should not be used in the home, let alone during an intimate moment. Wes should focus on understanding Leanne’s feelings and how to use bladders appropriately, rather than trying to shoehorn them into every situation.Adnaan, 30Leanne is well within her rights to ban the bladder from the bedroom and also from what functions as a bedroom while they are at the festival. This still leaves Wes plenty of opportunities to hydrate when he’s out and about, just not during sleep or sex!Harmony, 30It’s entirely reasonable to ask that the water bladder isn’t used in the bedroom. Yet, I think it is totally normal to use it in most other contexts, including at a festival.

    "content": "I am a man in my 60s. When my wife and I have sex, I can keep it up (as it were) for 45 minutes, including about 20 minutes of coitus. All of which I enjoy very much. The problem in recent years is my orgasm. When it arrives, it is a bit of a letdown. It happens extremely quickly and feels like a premature ejaculation, even though it has taken a long time to get there. It makes no difference whether I am on top and in charge of the pace or whether my wife is. How can I make my orgasms more enjoyable?Certain medications – whether prescription or over-the-counter – can change the nature of one’s orgasm, so consider whether the culprit could be in your medicine cabinet. If this is a possibility, you should consult with the prescribing physician to find out if there might be an alternative. Another element to investigate is whether your hormones might have something to do with it. For example, you might ask a doctor to look at your testosterone levels. Strong orgasms are fuelled partly by sex hormones such as testosterone, and an insufficiency could lead to the symptoms you are experiencing. Finally, I can tell that you are proud of your sexual prowess, but it might be a good idea to relax a bit on the expectations you set for yourself. A person usually has a better orgasm when they are able to let go of performance pressure. Try to focus simply on pleasure.

    "content": "Before I became a paramedic, I didn’t expect the job would change how I load a dishwasher. Or eat a sandwich. Or look at trampolines. I knew it would change how I see others – watching people die tends to do that. But nearly 10 years in, I’ve realised how much it’s quietly altered my day-to-day life.Being a paramedic makes you see danger everywhere, so you avoid risks because you’re always expecting you’ll need to spring into action, even when you’re not in uniform. Once you’ve seen as many stretchers loaded with avoidable disasters as I have, you end up wired differently, and always brace for the next catastrophe.I can’t walk into cafes, living rooms or kids’ birthday parties without conducting a risk assessment. I look for the nearest exits and sharp corners and often wonder if that defibrillator sitting on the wall covered in dust still works.At a party I once caught a toddler chewing on a deflated helium balloon. His parents were deep into their fourth round of Aperol spritzes, so I had to gently explain to them that a balloon can block an airway faster than you can sing Happy Birthday.It’s from experience more than from anxiety. A loose paver. Stray grapes. A poorly timed bomb into a pool. You stop seeing everyday life as nonthreatening once you’ve spent 45 minutes tearing apart someone’s lounge room on your hands and knees looking for a button battery in the hope it’s not halfway down a digestive tract.I will never again get on a motorbike, or on a trampoline. No judgment to the people who ride them. Or bounce on them. But I’ve been to too many scenes where someone came off second-best to physics. Motorbikes and trampolines both offer the illusion of freedom – right until the moment your femur is split into six parts.  for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning One of my first traumatic jobs involved a man who was clipped at an intersection. His helmet survived but his spinal cord didn’t. I’ve seen legs detached, ribcages shattered and vital organs thrown three metres from where they belonged.Trampolines have morbid minds of their own. I once treated a child who launched clean off the mat and on to a garden stake. Now, every time I see someone weaving through traffic in shorts and thongs – or letting their kid somersault unsupervised on a back yard trampoline – I think: “That’s too much paperwork for my day off.” I guess you could call it pattern recognition.I don’t touch recreational drugs – not that I would have anyway – because I’ve seen what happens when people assume their party cocaine isn’t laced with fentanyl. The Pulp Fiction-style overdoses aren’t fiction any more. And after watching the ketamine I’ve administered turn people into catatonic zombies, I’ve got no desire to try it myself (unless I take up trampolining and end up with a fractured femur).But just as I’ve learned to fear what others overlook, I’ve also stopped worrying about some of the things that send everyone else into a panic. I’ve lost count of the number of people who’ve called an ambulance because their smartwatch told them their heart rate was “elevated” or “irregular”. Some were convinced they were having a heart attack because the little waveform on the screen looks vaguely medical, as if a cheap wrist sensor compares to our $50,000 ECG machines. It’s usually anxiety. Or coffee.We also get alerts triggered by watches mistaking burpees for car accidents, or older people dropping their watches on the tiles and the sensor thinking they’ve fallen. It’s becoming the new version of rolling on to your VitalCall pendant in your sleep. I’m not anti-technology. I think these devices have their uses. But increasingly, people are outsourcing common sense to apps. Algorithms don’t do context.Maybe strapping on and plugging into these devices is our attempt to control life’s inevitable chaos, as if a notification might keep death at bay. But I’ve seen too much in my time to believe that kind of insurance is possible.Death doesn’t scare me any more. I’ve just learned to see it coming because I’ve seen it turn up in all the places you don’t expect. Like during a jog. Or in a McDonald’s toilet. Even halfway through mowing the lawn. I just assume the universe is indifferent.If anything, this has made me calm. Because I’m useful in a crisis, I’m more patient with people who panic over minor things. If someone cuts their hand on a poorly stacked knife in the dishwasher, I don’t stress. I grab a tea towel and tell them if they apply some pressure, they’ll live.

    "content": "I have a stepmother who my brother and I really despise. She has made our relationship with our dad really hard, and has tried to stop him seeing us at points. She has resented us since we were little. My dad has recently admitted that he thinks she is jealous of us and has a lot of regret for the way we were treated in the past.The trouble lies in the fact that he has said if anything happens to him (ie if he dies first) we would need to make an effort with her will-wise, to ensure we were treated fairly, as he doesn’t quite trust she would do the right thing.It feels incredibly hard to acknowledge this and agree when he has essentially admitted he doesn’t trust her with his dying wish. I also find it really hard to deal with the fact he is finally acknowledging how cruel she has been, but still insists we have a relationship. It makes me think he’s a coward. I really want to bring this up to him, but have no idea how to say: “Do you not think you should reconsider your marriage, based on the way in which you have shown you don’t trust your wife, and believe she is jealous of your children?”Eleanor says: First non-philosophical thing: if you haven’t already, I think you should get legal advice about the will. Is it that he might die intestate, and he’s hoping you’ll all sort it out? Or has he made arrangements, but worries she might challenge them?Legal advice would clarify what can be done now to avoid a horrible tangle later. That’s hard – nobody likes to get into the details about their dad’s death. Or indeed their own. But it’ll be so much harder, emotionally and legally, if your first advice about a possible estate conflict only comes after he’s died.To your question. You said you weren’t sure how to say what you wanted to say. When we say “I can’t figure out how to say such-and-such”, I always think the answer is to just say the such-and-such. You wrote it: “Do you not think you should reconsider your marriage, based on the ways you don’t trust your wife, and believe she’s jealous of your children?”A heady thing to say, for sure. But it’s not the word choice that makes it heady. You’d be asking your dad why he’s still married. You can soften the phrasing, but it’s the content of that question that makes us flinch, not the way of asking it.More frightening still is the fact that he might have an answer. Through your (and my) eyes that question is almost rhetorical: why stay married to someone you don’t trust and who’s mean to your kids? However, the fact that they are still married and that he wants you to have a relationship with her means that, for him, there might well be an answer. He might have considerations on the other side of the scale that outweigh the fact that she’s mean to his kids.Maybe he likes her enough. Maybe he doesn’t want to be alone. Maybe he thinks he’s too old, he’s not willing to make the change. Maybe he thinks the conflicts between her and his kids aren’t his concern.Maybe what look like obvious dealbreakers to you are just some considerations among many for him.The point is, your real question for him might be an even bigger flinch. Not just “why won’t you act on your judgment?”, but “why isn’t it your judgment that you should leave?” It’s possible he has bona fide answers – things that, to him, are more important than the way she treats you.It is hard to say which would hurt more: him not being brave enough to act on what he values, or this being exactly what it looks like when he does. I truly don’t know which of these it is. I feel for you the same in both cases. I don’t know whether you should ask him either question out loud; I don’t know how conversations with him tend to go, or whether his answer would make you feel better.I do know that when someone isn’t acting on what they say they see, it isn’t always that they lack the courage of their convictions. Sometimes they’re showing us their convictions through inaction.Ask Eleanor a question"

    "title": "A hero among hormones: why cortisol is something to celebrate rather than stress about",
    "author": "Joel Snape",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/27/a-hero-among-hormones-why-cortisol-is-something-to-celebrate-rather-than-stress-about",
    "published": "2025-08-01T06:45:33.111058+00:00",
    "content": "Of all the hormones produced by the body, cortisol is the most misunderstood. It’s essential to any number of biological processes, and yet commonly typecast as “the one to do with stress” – an evolutionary adaptation for different times, wildly unsuited to modern living, something to reduce with meditation, reset with ice baths or regulate with red-light therapy.Personal trainers will tell you to avoid long runs in case they result in “cortisol belly”, while influencers diagnose “cortisol face” as a sign of too much pressure in the office. To top it all, social media has recently seen the rise of the “cortisol cocktail” – a combination of coconut water, orange juice, salt, and lemon that TikTokers claim can reduce stress and help with weight loss.But how much of this has any kind of scientific validity – and is worrying about your cortisol levels doing you more harm than good?The first thing to understand is what cortisol is, and what it actually does: and yes, that does include helping to manage our response to external stressors. In situations that the body perceives as fight-or-flight, it helps the body to produce immediate energy – as well as suppressing non-essential functions such as digestion or repair (we’ll get to whether this is a bad thing or not shortly). “Cortisol plays a vital role in blood-sugar regulation, by prompting the liver to produce glucose and helping ensure a steady supply of fuel to the brain and body,” says Hannah Alderson, a nutritionist, hormone specialist and author of Everything I Know About Hormones. “It also helps modulate inflammation, keeping immune responses in check and preventing them from going into overdrive. It’s key in how we metabolise fat, protein and carbohydrate.” It also regulates blood pressure, can act as a mood buffer, and kicks in to help fight infection if we’re recovering from an acute illness. But one of its most vital roles is also its least talked-about.“It’s the hormone that gets us out of bed,” says Angela Clow, emeritus professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. “You get this burst of it in the morning, which is called the ‘cortisol awakening response’. That’s not a bad thing or a stress response – it’s the body’s way of waking up and promoting cognitive function. You’ve probably experienced a time when you have an early flight or a busy day ahead, and your body anticipates it and wakes you up without needing an alarm clock. That’s cortisol priming your brain to be more alert and more active, preparing you for the day ahead.”Research published earlier this year confirmed that cortisol is already increasing from its lowest point about three hours before you wake up – putting to rest any idea that getting up itself is stressful for the body, and suggesting instead that rising cortisol levels are part of what gets us ready for the day. Like every other higher organism on the planet, we’ve evolved to live in an environment that’s dark for (roughly) half of every day, and so our body needs a way to switch from restoration into activity, which seems to be one of cortisol’s key roles.“A very large proportion of the genes in your body are sensitive to cortisol,” says Stafford Lightman, a professor of medicine at Bristol Medical School and co-author on the recent research. “And so cortisol has a daily rhythm, and that daily rhythm regulates multiple genes in multiple tissues; in your brain, your liver and your immune system.”As part of this process, cortisol levels gradually decline throughout the day, with periodic bursts approximately every 90 minutes helping to maintain proper bodily function. This certainly isn’t a bad thing, but it does make gauging it difficult: you could take two measurements 30 minutes apart and get two wildly differing numbers. Under laboratory conditions, researchers take cortisol readings from blood or saliva multiple times a day to obtain a general picture of how volunteers’ levels fluctuate and respond to stressors. At-home tests are much less useful: if you’re only testing yourself once or twice a day, the only thing you might notice is that your levels are very high or very low.So what about the idea that the minor stresses of everyday life are constantly keeping our cortisol levels perilously high? One common characterisation of the way this might work is that our bodies, evolved to deal with sabre-tooth tiger attacks and flash floods, can’t easily distinguish between those sorts of immediate, physical threats and more psychological ones – an argument on the school run, say, or a nasty email from a client. Social stressors, the theory goes, can be insidious: they’re basically ever-present, especially if we’re prone to catastrophise, and if our bodies’ restorative systems switch themselves off every time we encounter them, we’ll never have time for rest and repair.In baboon troops – which are very social and hierarchical – this effect is visible, with the lower-pecking-order males suffering with worse immunity and shorter lifespans, as their fight-or-flight systems are constantly prioritised over the rest-and-digest ones. But baboon lives tend to be genuinely far more stressful than human ones – if you’re kicked out of the troop or can’t find a mate, you’re facing a genuine, near-immediate threat to your genes’ survival, rather than just feeling a bit put out. There’s speculation, of course, that our bodies can’t make this sort of distinction, and that we still internally respond to having our birthday forgotten at the office like we would to banishment on the savannah. But is that really true?As it turns out, probably not. To test the effect of short-term bursts of stress, psychologists have developed all sorts of unpleasant laboratory procedures – from cold-water immersion to problem-solving under time pressure, to the Trier Social Stress Test, where volunteers are tasked with delivering a speech and mental arithmetic task in front of an unresponsive panel of evaluators. And the effect isn’t as pronounced as you might have been led to believe.“Trying to stress a human is really difficult,” says Lightman. “Even plunging your hand into freezing-cold water has very little effect. If you’ve got a really important job interview that is going to govern the rest of your life, then yes, that’s probably going to be stressful. But it’s very subjective – some people, of course, actually like giving presentations in front of a crowd. With things like the Trier test, you might get a reaction the first time, and then you won’t again – just understanding what the test is about is enough to destroy the effect.”This means you’re unlikely to be suffering spikes in cortisol from the odd snippy Zoom call or altercation at the self-checkout – and, even if your body sees those situations as a threat to your wellbeing, there are other systems that kick in first. “It’s not just cortisol that goes up in stressful situations,” says Dr Thomas Upton, a clinical research fellow who also worked on the recent study. “There are other hormones – like catecholamines, your adrenaline and noradrenaline – that play key roles in the immediate part of the fight-or-flight response. This is what helps you ‘fight the lion’ and get yourself out of the situation, followed up by cortisol release if the stress is strong enough or long enough. What you’re feeling in a very stressful situation like a jump scare is a rush of adrenaline that makes your heart pound and your mouth go dry and all the rest of it.”Brief, short-term stress is probably not doing you any harm, then. But does this mean heightened cortisol becomes more of an issue when you’re continuously stressed over the long term – for instance, from worrying about a family problem or the mortgage – or even deliberately putting yourself through too many difficult workouts?“That’s a bit trickier,” says Prof Clow. “If you just have a short burst of perceived stress, you will have a little burst of cortisol. That’s fine: your body will speedily return to normal cortisol secretion. But if you’re chronically stressed, repeatedly getting these bursts, that can affect the regulation of your underlying circadian pattern, which is regulated by your biological clock. So that, instead of having a healthy dynamic pattern of cortisol secretion over each 24 hours, you get ‘flat-lining’, which is not able to regulate other processes adequately.”Constant stress, then, is probably bad for your cognitive function and health. But cortisol is unlikely to change how you look, unless there are larger problems at play. “If you had Cushing’s syndrome, which is a rare condition where cortisol levels in the body are very high, for example due to a tumour of the adrenal gland, then yes, you might gain extra weight around the stomach, or notice that your face becomes round and puffy,” says Niamh Martin, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London. “But that tends to be with very, very high cortisol levels.”And, while it’s true that something like a long run can elevate cortisol levels over the short term, that doesn’t mean there’s any need to ditch your plans for a new personal best. “Doing, say, a marathon is a massively stressful situation for the body,” says Upton. “You need a cortisol response in that situation, and there’s nothing wrong with it: if you didn’t have that response, the results would probably be terrible. You might actually die.”The good news, then, is that you can happily ignore the most outlandish advice about keeping cortisol in check with cocktails or cold plunges. Unless you’re suffering from a clear medical issue, you probably also don’t need to worry about how your cortisol’s changing on a daily or hourly basis. Several companies are working on methods for continuously monitoring cortisol levels as you go about your everyday life – but even these could do most people more harm than good. “Something that we’ve seen with glucose monitors is that they create a lot of ‘worried well’ people who put one on, have their breakfast and say, oh hell, my blood sugar’s gone up too much,” says Lightman. “And then they start worrying about doing all sorts of things and make themselves ill. If you’re an Olympic sprinter or something, continuous monitoring might be useful. But, among most people, there’s so much individual variation that the range we call ‘normal’ is huge.”There’s one more obvious question here, though: if cortisol isn’t the culprit, why does stress seem to go hand in hand with poor health, immune-system disruption and weight gain? “It’s very difficult to unpick,” says Martin. “For instance, many of us have a complex relationship with food – and there are behavioural reasons why we eat besides being hungry – so it’s easy to blame cortisol if we notice that we’re gaining weight, but it might also be that, because we’re stressed, we’re eating in a different way. Similarly, you might be having a tough time at work and that means you don’t have time to exercise, or you’re not sleeping well because you’re stressed and that’s negatively affecting your cortisol levels, rather than the relationship going the other way. Part of the issue is that we still don’t fully understand the chronic stresses that modern life involves and what their impact is on our bodies over a long period of time.”So what does all this mean for you and your life – stressful or otherwise? “I think the most evidence-backed approach is to treat cortisol as something like a bystander, rather than blaming it for any issues you’re having,” says Martin. “If you’re chronically stressed, that’s something to deal with for health reasons, but it’s not necessarily a question of artificially finding ways to keep your cortisol down – it’s more holistic than that. The most important thing is to look after yourself, rather than reaching for an expensive supplement or a cortisol cocktail or anything like that.”“There are a few things that seem to help keep cortisol well regulated,” says Clow. “The research suggests, for instance, that the earlier you wake – within reason – promotes a healthy and dynamic cortisol rhythm. So getting plenty of sleep and then getting up relatively early seems to be very good for you. There’s increasing evidence that night-time light exposure inhibits your melatonin secretion, which liberates cortisol and allows it to rise while you sleep.” It’s worth mentioning, though, that getting enough sleep – and on a regular schedule – might be more important.Physical exercise seems to keep cortisol well regulated but, if you can’t face the gym, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. “Gentle exercise, like walking, stretching or pilates, can regulate cortisol far better than an hour-long Hiit class on an empty stomach,” says Alderson. “Breath work is amazing and you can do it anywhere. Micromoments of joy are a lot simpler to weave in than grand gestures like week-long yoga retreats – and, even if they’re not directly affecting your cortisol, they matter more than people realise. A laugh, a hug, a walk in nature: this stuff really matters.”Finally, it’s important to remember that, even if modern living does occasionally nudge your hormones outside optimal levels, cortisol is on your side. Your body’s stress response to most things should be good for you. Try to get some exercise every day, sleep on a regular schedule, and eat as sensibly as you can. Don’t worry about the other stuff: you really don’t need the stress."

    "content": "My partner and I are both creatives. Six years ago we were living in a tiny apartment in Sydney’s inner west, and I was paying extra for a studio. It wasn’t sustainable so we decided to move to Katoomba, on the traditional lands of the Dharug and Gundungurra people.I read an article recently saying something like “skip it, it’s not at its best” but Katoomba has a beautiful authenticity, even if it’s not quite polished.Our closest upper mountain towns are Leura and Blackheath. Katoomba is all old-world treasures and beautiful building facades. Blackheath has the incredible Victory Theatre Antique Centre, Gleebooks, Hat Hill Records & Audio and great rock climbing and hikes. Leura has an upscale main drag full of lifestyle and fashion stores, but it gets busy on weekends. I recommend walking the backstreets to see the cute cottages and gardens.FoodOur favourite place to eat is the award-winning Ates in Blackheath. It serves delicious Mediterranean-style share plates and always feels like a special night out. Much of its food is cooked in its 150-year-old wood-fired oven and there’s a greenery-filled courtyard.On weekends, Tempus Katoomba has a fine-dining menu with an incredible all-Australian drinks list. It’s in the old bank and lots of historical parts remain but the interiors are fun and fresh. On weekday mornings it switches to the Tempest Up Early cafe, serving Little Marionette coffee.We’re so lucky to have Black Cockatoo bakery here. It’s run by a French expat Alexandre Rivière and uses organic Australian flour and Pepe Saya cultured butter. Savoury or sweet, it’s all delicious. It’s a cool space, too, with custom ply joinery and lots of plants.We just discovered The Laughing Elephant in Wentworth Falls. It’s an Asian grocer but they make amazing banh mi and laksa at lunchtimes.Fidelity is a new cafe run by two super-warm and welcoming guys with a deep passion for coffee. The seating spills outside with lots of dogs and friendly vibes. I drink decaf and often feel self-conscious but the baristas at Fidelity are like, “You’ve got to try this decaf!” The house-made chai is great too. Cassiopeia has great coffee and baked goods too; it roasts its beans in Leura.NatureLyrebird Dell walking track in Leura is magical. It’s shaded and cool with waterfalls and tree ferns so it’s great in summer. You can detour down to the Pool of Siloam waterhole for a swim. It has a sandy beach and doesn’t get too crowded.Lockley Pylon is a three-hour walk (7.2km return) mostly along a ridge in north Leura. It’s known for stunning wildflowers in spring, like boronia and waratah. It’s very exposed, so walking on windy or super-hot days is not advised. At the end there’s an incredible view over the Grose Valley.Wentworth Falls Lake Park has a new walkway and a viewing platform along the eastern edge that’s pram and wheelchair-friendly. The area still feels wild in places but there’s also a big playground, a cute jetty and ducks. People kayak and canoe here; we like to swim on the north side in the shade of the gumtrees. It’s busy on weekends with people barbecuing and picnicking.Minnehaha Falls in North Katoomba is 2.7km return with some stairs, but the waterhole at the end is a sublime swimming spot. The track follows Yosemite Creek which has loads of scribbly gums and banksia.I love native plants but I’m also a sucker for the lilacs, tulips and maples at Everglades House and Gardens. The art deco house is a wonderful glimpse into the past and you can do Devonshire tea in the tearoom. The 12-acre garden is manicured in some parts and bushy in others and you can picnic on the lawn.NightlifeDown in the Lawson industrial area (15 minutes’ drive east of Katoomba) is a quarterly experimental arts event run by SIRC_UIT. It’s always a unique experience, with performance and installation, and there’s a pop-up bar and food.Zoe’s Blackheath has live music, Italian-influenced pub-style food and a great bar for a casual drink.Mountain Culture Brewpub in Katoomba is in a rambling 1900s building. The co-owner is originally from North Carolina; it has won many awards for its beers. There’s great views and yummy burgers and fried pickles.Aqua Ignis is a new sauna and bathhouse in Blackheath that’s open until 9pm. It has magnesium baths and a herbal steam room; it’s such a restorative evening. Blue Mountains Sauna in Leura has been around longer; it’s a more traditional Nordic-style space with regular clothing optional sessions.InspirationBlue Mountains Cultural Centre in Katoomba is a crucial stop for art lovers. It features touring shows, such as the Archibald prize and the Wynne prize, as well as exhibitions from renowned local artists such as Claire Healy, Sean Cordeiro and Nick Stathopoulos. There’s also an immersive permanent video installation filmed in the national park.I’m a mural artist, and the encouragement of street art here is so nice. Me and four other female mural artists painted the Froma Lane walkway that connects Katoomba Street to the centre.Beverley Place was really dilapidated 10 years ago before it was transformed into the Katoomba Street Art Walk. When a wall mural fades a new artist is invited to paint it. It’s a really cool space to walk through. The cultural centre runs short street art tours or you can use a self-guided map.Landslide Gallery in Wentworth Falls was once an old flour mill. It runs an Australia-wide and international artist-in-residency program and its exhibitions showcase the incredibly diverse mediums of Blue Mountains artists, from ceramics to sculpture, paintings and textile art.Day Gallery is a commercial gallery in Blackheath; the couple behind it, Helen and Vincent Day, are legends. Their roster of artists is truly inspiring. During Covid lockdowns, renowned local painter and musician Claire Nakazawa (from the band Haiku Hands) created a mural on the external wall as her response to the landscapes after the black summer fires.NeighbourhoodThe area around the Blue Mountains Cultural Centre in Katoomba is getting so vibrant. Katoomba Civic Centre’s gardens are re-landscaped with tree ferns and banksias, and it’s a lovely stroll through the Carrington hotel’s garden down to Katoomba Street.The Blue Mountains Co-op is near there and has a kiosk with the most amazing soups. The co-op market garden is next to the cultural centre and the Carrington hotel. It’s run by Farm it Forward, which makes unused pieces of land productive. This patch was long abandoned and now it has a head farmer and the co-op sells its seasonal organic produce. I painted a produce-inspired mural on an adjoining heritage-listed wall to bring some joy and to revive the space.AccommodationThe Carrington (from $230 a night) is an old-world beauty and I love looking at the historical photographs of how Katoomba began, with just the Carrington at the top of the hill and this rickety train line.The Kyah (from $190 per night) is a very cool renovated motel in Blackheath. It has a great restaurant called Blaq, gardens, a tennis court and a hot tub.Chalets at Blackheath (from $1,300 a night; sleeps two) are very high-end and dreamy. There are four freestanding chalets with bushland views. They have fireplaces, bathtubs and a sundeck; you’re really immersed in the environment and birdsong.Cloud Parade (from $1,095 a night; sleeps 10) is an Airbnb in Leura with lovely interiors and stunning valley views. It’s only a 15-minute walk to the town centre, which is impressive, because often places with views this good are a fair hike from the shops.

    "content": "Mollie O’Callaghan has equalled the Australian record for world championship golds after anchoring the women to victory in the 4x200m freestyle relay in Singapore.By securing her 11th career world title on Thursday night, the 21-year-old equalled Ian Thorpe’s Australian record.O’Callaghan is favourite to win her 12th gold in the 100m freestyle on Friday night after reaching the final as fastest qualifier. “It was pretty rough backing it up … [but] it’s a dream to be part of this team,” she said.The victory of O’Callaghan, Lani Pallister, Jamie Perkins and Brittany Castelluzzo was Australia’s third relay gold of the meet and came as the Dolphins also bagged two bronze medals on Thursday night.Kyle Chalmers (men’s 100m freestyle) and Lizzie Dekkers (women’s 200m butterfly) both reached the podium and it means Australia retain top spot on the medal tally with five golds, one silver and five bronze. The United States are second on four golds.Chalmers made it a 14th career medal at world titles but didn’t find the gold he was hoping for as he finished behind Romania’s David Popovici (46.51 seconds) and American Jack Alexy (46.92).However, he remains confident that he can break the sub-47 second mark in the 100m freestyle.Chalmers clocked 47.17 and is yet to swim the race in less than 47 seconds, which is now the realm of world winners.“I have been training hard for that moment, I desperately wanted to get a 46 out tonight, but it wasn’t quite there,” he told Channel Nine. “But to get on the podium is so special.”Chalmers has twice logged personal best times of 47.08 and at the age of 27 believes he can still improve – but he now has other priorities.Chalmers and his partner, Norwegian swimmer Ingeborg Loyning, are expecting their first child next month.“I’m just really excited to go home now and become a dad, that is my biggest priority this year – that [swim] was just a bit of fun,” he said.Chalmers also won gold in Singapore when anchoring Australia’s 4x100m freestyle relay team on Sunday’s opening night.Earlier on Thursday night, Chalmers’ teammate Dekkers took the bronze in a women’s 200m butterfly won by Canadian star Summer McIntosh – the 18-year-old’s third gold of the titles.“Physically, I’m not at my best,” Dekkers said. “So I knew that mentally, I had to be there … I love racing, and that’s why we all do this, because there’s something about standing behind the blocks that we all love.”O’Callaghan cruised through her women’s 100m freestyle semi-final and into Friday night’s medal race as fastest qualifier.O’Callaghan, already with golds in the 200m freestyle and women’s 4x100m relay in Singapore, won her semi in 52.82 seconds but fellow Australian Olivia Wunsch withdrew due to illness.O’Callaghan later Thursday night will race in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay and, if victorious, will equal Ian Thorpe’s Australian record for most golds at world titles, 11."

    "content": "If the British & Irish Lions complete a clean sweep against the Wallabies on Saturday in Sydney, there will be more talk of Australia no longer being a sufficiently challenging destination for a Lions tour. It’s a mirror image of what has happened to the rugby league Lions over the past 15 years, with Australia deciding that neither Great Britain nor England brought the jeopardy, ticket sales or eyeballs required to justify an incoming tour. Instead, the Kangaroos will visit London, Liverpool and Leeds later this year to play England.It has been 33 years since Great Britain toured Australia. Martin Offiah lit up that series in 1992, scoring seven tries in six Tests against Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand. Offiah, who won 33 caps for Great Britain, as well as five for England, cannot believe the Rugby Football League and Australian Rugby League have allowed these showcase events to fade from view. “As a nation we’ve got to have regular fixtures against Australia,” says Offiah. “Not playing them since the World Cup final in 2017 is crazy. When you’re trying to get across that bridge and match them, that’s a massive gap. And we should have been Great Britain for this series – then gone back to England for the World Cup.”Andy Farrell’s team are in action in Sydney, a rugby league citadel, on Saturday; it has been 19 years since the league Lions played there – a shock win in 2006. Most Super League stars this century have never worn the Lions shirt against Australia. Sam Burgess didn’t. Sam Tomkins didn’t represent Great Britain at all. And current superstars Jack Welsby and Herbie Farnworth have not even seen the league Lions play. Let’s explain a sorry tale.When did the Lions start playing?Despite containing dozens of Welshmen, several Scots and an occasional Irishman, for decades the RFL’s national team was known as England. The catalyst for change was the iconic 1946 Indomitables tour, when an “England” squad containing 11 Welshmen docked at Tilbury having won 21 of their 27 games on their tour to Australia and New Zealand. By the time the 1950 tour came round, they were called Great Britain and nicknamed the Lions.When did league let the Lions escape?Young fans could be mistaken for assuming that the union Lions have always toured New Zealand, Australia and South Africa on rotation. Not so. While the league side were visiting the southern hemisphere every four years, union tours were more sporadic, at times up to nine years apart. That has changed in the professional era. Since 1997, the league Lions have toured just three times, the union side eight. Rugby league had the Lions brand and calendar in its hands, but let it slip.In 2007, the RFL declared the series against New Zealand would be the last in Great Britain. The intention was to put more emphasis on the four Home Nations and for the Lions to tour every four years. But 12 years passed before their next tour – and most wish it hadn’t happened at all. The 2019 tour was a historic low, with four straight Test defeats in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.How did they allow this to happen?Initially results did not matter – until they did. Great Britain won just two of their 24 Tests against Australia between a 21-12 victory at an almost empty Wembley in 1973 and a dead-rubber win in Sydney in 1988, including 15 straight defeats. But the Kangaroos kept coming. As long as it made sense on and off the field, the teams met every two years, switching between the northern and southern hemispheres.As the current union tour illustrates, if the commercial opportunities add up, the teams will play. The match on Saturday will be the ninth time Andy Farrell’s side have taken to the field in Australia in five weeks.The league Lions were competitive without being successful and, ultimately, Australia realised they had stronger competition and bigger interest closer to home. Australia were meant to host three Tests in the 2019 tour but they pulled out, leaving the Lions to visit New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. They lost to all three, which was reason enough for some to abandon the Lions for good.Why has the RFL not brought back the Lions?Having canvassed supporters for their opinions, the RFL decided 2025 was not the time to bring back the Great Britain team, given that England are preparing for a World Cup next year and the Celtic nations would contribute little.Had the Lions toured in 2023, continuing the four-year cycle, Scotland lock James Bell might have been picked, alongside a handful of Ireland internationals. But if Shaun Wane were selecting a Great Britain team this October, it would look near-identical to England anyway.Players such as James McDonnell and Morgan Knowles – formerly of Ireland and Wales, respectively – have declared for England in any case. The only player not eligible for England who might make a Lions team is Jaimin Jolliffe, the Gold Coast Titans and Ireland prop. That alone is not a convincing case for the return of the league Lions.Is there a future for the league Lions?The Lions are dormant, but not necessarily extinct. England host Australia later this year, with a return trip pencilled in for 2028. Nigel Wood, back in charge at the RFL, is keen on the Lions reuniting, possibly for that tour, although another option is available.The union Lions launch their tours with money-spinning home games – they played Argentina in Dublin last month, bringing in some much-needed money for both teams. Gate receipts alone yielded in the region of €3m, with the Pumas paid a €1m appearance fee. The league Lions played home fixtures every year for decades and at least one senior RFL employee likes the idea of the four Home Nations uniting to host series against the Kangaroos and Kiwis. No other major team sport does that. It would be unique.The Celtic nations may not be stocked with talent but they have contributed a lot to the team over the years. Only two players have won Lions series in the southern hemisphere in both codes and neither of them is English: Lewis Jones from Wales and Alan Tait from Scotland. And​, enticed with the prospect of facing Australia, it is not hard to imagine Scottish, Welsh and Irish rugby fans getting behind the team. Reviving the Lions would restore one of international rugby league’s unique selling points. Goodness knows, the sport needs it.Follow No Helmets Required on Facebook"

    "content": "Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin has requested a trade, according to multiple reports on Thursday.Frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiations toward a contract extension, McLaurin sat out the first four days of training camp before reporting on Sunday. After reporting, he can no longer be fined $50,000 per day.McLaurin, who turns 30 in September, became a hold-in and was placed on the team’s physically unable to perform list with an apparent ankle injury suffered last season. He did not attend organized team activities and mandatory minicamp. He did, however, participate in spring workouts.“You’d like to get these things done quicker, but it doesn’t always happen that way,” general manager Adam Peters said. “Whatever happens along the way, just understand he’s a great player and we want to keep him here.”With a base salary of $15.5m and cap hit of $25.5m in the final season of a three-year, $68.3m contract, the speedster is coming off a career year with 1,096 receiving yards, 13 touchdowns and 82 receptions on 117 targets. He added three scores and 227 yards on 14 receptions in three playoff games.McLaurin and rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels helped lead Washington (12-5) to their best season since it won the Super Bowl in 1991. The Commanders knocked off the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC wild-ard round and Detroit Lions in the divisional round before falling to the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game.Over six seasons with Washington, the two-time Pro Bowl selection (2022, 2024) has 6,379 receiving yards, 38 touchdowns and 460 catches in 97 games.A team captain, McLaurin has hit the 1,000-yard mark for a franchise-record five straight seasons despite instability at the quarterback position before Daniels’ NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year campaign."

    "content": "Andy Farrell has described suggestions the Wallabies are not worthy opponents of the British & Irish Lions as “insulting” and believes it would be a mistake to scrap tours of Australia.The Lions can wrap up their first clean sweep since 1927 if they beat the Wallabies in Saturday’s third Test in Sydney and become the first Lions side to go unbeaten since 1974. The Lions have already made history by becoming the first touring side to clinch a second straight series win over the same opponent and are odds-on favourites to secure a 3-0 whitewash.The Wallabies are languishing at sixth in the world rankings and although they came within 50 seconds of levelling the series in Melbourne were well beaten in the Brisbane opener. The six warm-up victories have been largely one-sided – the five-point win over the First Nations & Pasifika XV notwithstanding – raising questions as to whether the Lions should continue to tour Australia or seek different opponents, such as France or Argentina.The French federation vice-president Abdel Benazzi said this month that he intended to discuss a “new business model” with the Lions. Benazzi was adamant he did not want to do so at the expense of Australia, but Sir Clive Woodward, who coached the Lions in 2005, and Brian Moore, who featured on two tours, have said consideration should be given to scheduling different opponents.Australia’s head coach, Joe Schmidt, chose not to release a number of his players to feature in the warm-up games and this provided more ammunition. The 2029 tour of New Zealand is all but signed off, but there is no agreement in place over future tours.The Lions captain, Maro Itoje, said on Tuesday that his preference would be to stick with the traditional opponents and on Thursday Farrell said: “I don’t think [touring Australia] was ever off the agenda. Every single team, country, province, has their ups and downs, but Australia – the sporting nation they are – are always going to come back.“That [performance last] weekend is no surprise to us and why we expect them to be better. Have a look at the year they’ve got coming up. They’re going to be a force to be reckoned with, 100%, with all their experiences, come the World Cup in 2027 [in Australia].“Hopefully, [this tour] will be remembered for the type of rugby we played and the way that we went about it. We came here and wanted to win a series. We’ve achieved that, but we have a massive responsibility to make sure we finish this off with something we promised ourselves with.“It’s a big ask, but it’s something that we’re determined to do. [Winning 3-0 is] something we’ve talked about from day one and we’ve put ourselves in a position to put that on the line, so that’s why it means so much to us.”Despite already securing the series, Farrell has resisted making wholesale changes for the final Test with just two to the starting lineup. Blair Kinghorn replaces James Lowe on the left wing while James Ryan comes in at second-row. Ollie Chessum drops to a 6-2 bench that includes Jac Morgan and Ben Earl.Morgan’s clearout on Carlo Tizzano in the buildup to Hugo Keenan’s last-minute try last week has been hotly debated with the Wallabies adamant the score ought to have been chalked off. Tizzano, for his part, has been accused of playacting, but Schmidt revealed on Thursday that the clearout registered a force of 54G. Schmidt has chosen to omit the flanker for the third Test and said “he’s copped a lot of online abuse”.Farrell, who lashed out when his son Owen was targeted after his red card against Wales in a 2023 World Cup warm-up match, said: “Online abuse is clear and obvious. It’s disgusting. It shouldn’t be that way.”"

    "content": "Maëva Squiban from Brittany won stage six of the Tour de France Femmes after a 32km breakaway through the forestclimbs of the Livradois-Forez national park to Ambert. The 23-year-old held off the pursuing peloton of favourites on the final climb to claim the biggest win of her career and the second stage win for a French rider since the women’s race was rebooted as the Tour de France Femmes in 2022.Squiban, riding for UAE Team ADQ, attacked alone, three kilometres from the top of the Col du Chansert, and maintained her lead on the fast descent, through the bonus sprint and into the finishing straight on the Boulevard Henri IV.“When they told me I had a minute and a half [lead] I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I mainly wanted to get a head start before the climb to the bonus sprint. Then I was hoping to be part of a small group from the bonus sprint to the finish.”Behind her, Kim Le Court was as good as her word at the bonus sprints and made every second count. The Mauritian took another four seconds, just ahead of the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma, to extend her overall lead. “The goal was to control the race, and then see if the legs were there,” she said. “After that, it was to take the remaining bonus seconds, as there was already a rider up ahead.”“We tried to close the gap to Squiban to try and get the stage, but it wasn’t going to happen so tried to get a bit more time at the finish. I couldn’t wish for it to be better, apart from maybe winning the stage.”The 29-year-old leads by 26 seconds from Pauline Ferrand-Prévot and by 30 seconds from Niewiadoma, who leap-frogged the pre-race favourite, Demi Vollering, into third place.The first mountain stage included 2,475m of altitude gain over four categorised climbs, including the first category Col du Beal, and provoked significant time gaps. Marianne Vos tumbled down the yellow jersey rankings, dropping from sixth to 29th.Although the rest of the favourites stayed together over the top of the 10km climb, Cédrine Kerbaol and Niewiadoma tried their hand on the descent, but were recaptured at the foot of the Col du Chansert, the platform for Squiban’s solo attack.Vollering’s FDJ-Suez team-mate Juliette Labous set off in pursuit in the closing kilometres, but it was not enough to draw out any initiatives from the main challengers.Ferrand-Prévot, gold medallist in Olympic mountain biking, has been a discreet presencesince showing an explosive acceleration on stage one. Her stealthy performance is fuelling French hopes that she may break the nation’s 40-year Tour de France drought.The apparent anxieties from the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, over Vollering’s chances may be heightened by the prospect of a French rider being guided to overall victory by his nemesis, Visma–Lease a Bike’s Jos Van Emden, although the pair now appear to have ended their public feud.Friday’s stage from Bourg-en-Bresse to Chambéry has less altitude gain, but is expected to inflict yet more pain as it crosses the summit of the 1,134m Col du Granier, 17km from the finish. With three mountain stages still to come, 132 of 154 starters remain in the race."

    "content": "The hottest property in the AFL happens to have the coolest head in the game. St Kilda sensation Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera completed his sparkling rise from a damaging defender and one of the most exciting midfielders in the competition, to a proven match-winner after icing two goals in the final minute that sealed a historic comeback against Melbourne.The 22-year-old has already shown he can do it all at both ends. But it is rare for a player to have a game-changing impact in all areas of the field in one game, let alone in a single breathtaking quarter that helped turn Sunday’s contest. Wanganeen-Milera started the game taking on the Demons’ decorated on-ball brigade, but with the Saints trailing by 46 points at the final change he was soon taking the kick ins, connecting play through the midfield and drifting forward to be a target in attack.The defender-turned-allrounder gathered 10 disposals as the Saints came from the clouds to chase down the Demons in the final term. But it is Wanganeen-Milera’s last minute of action at Marvel Stadium that will go down in folklore. It is a tale that even the humble Saints star struggled to explain.“I don’t know, I’m a bit speechless,” Wanganeen-Milera told Channel 7 immediately after the game. “It just sort of happened, I flew for it. But my teammates did a great job in the last quarter, the pressure was unreal, we just kept fighting and fighting.”The Demons led by a goal with less than a minute left on the clock when Saints midfielder Mason Wood received a handball after a boundary throw-in on the wing and bombed the ball into the forward 50. Wanganeen-Milera first made his name as a rebounding half-back and has shown plenty of promise since moving into the midfield, but with the game on the line he soared over Bailey Fritsch to pull down a screamer in front of Demons defender Judd McVee within sight of goal.The exquisitely skilled Wanganeen-Milera could hardly have split the middle better as he nailed the set shot to level the scores with only eight seconds remaining and leave the Saints looking like the only side thinking about victory. While the young St Kilda players were calm and composed amid the chaos that followed, even the most experienced Demons lost their heads as they turned the ball over with a 6-6-6 infringement for not having enough players set up in each area of the ground.The Saints trio of Rowan Marshall, Marcus Windhager and Wanganeen-Milera quickly concocted a plan at the centre bounce for the ruck to take the free kick and pick out the man of the moment charging forward. A pinpoint pass from Marshall was enough to find Wanganeen-Milera just inside the 50m arc as he bravely marked while falling backwards. He sprang back to his feet before the siren sounded. “I just told the forwards, ‘get out of my way’, and then I told Rowan, ‘just hit me on the left side’, and it was lucky I got on the end of it,” Wanganeen-Milera said.With the result resting on his young shoulders, Wanganeen-Milera only needed a point to clinch the greatest comeback from a three-quarter-time deficit in VFL/AFL history. It was no surprise to see his lethal right foot send the ball through the middle again for the icing on the cake of a stunning six-point triumph. Wanganeen-Milera finished with 34 disposals, nine score involvements, six clearances and a career-high four goals in just the latest display as his career keeps reaching for new heights.If only to add to the mythical performance, coach Ross Lyon revealed after the game that the Saints’ hero of the day was on the brink of being a late withdrawal from the game due to a stye in his eye before getting the all-clear from the club doctor. “[The doctor] said ‘Nas has come in, [we’ve] upped his antibiotics, given him an injection,” Lyon said. “I mean, they can sound quite morbid at times, the doctors. I just said, ‘how’s Nas’, he’s pretty confident. Then I rang him, he goes, ‘no, I’ll be right’. But I just said, if you’re not right, no pressure, we’ll tap you out.” There will be a sense of relief as much as elation around the Saints’ camp that Wanganeen-Milera was available to take on the Demons, but both will only grow if the speedster commits his long-term future to the club.The stepson of former St Kilda player Terry Milera and nephew of former Port Adelaide and Essendon great Gavin Wanganeen owns the most sought-after signature in the game, as he comes out of contract while being courted by both clubs in his home state of South Australia. Wanganeen-Milera has already ensured that St Kilda are etched in the record books for their fightback, but the club that drafted him at No 11 in 2021 AFL draft live in hope that his incredible performance against Melbourne was just one of many memorable moments to come in red, white and black."

    "content": "On his third team in his fifth season, Trey Lance played like a No 3 overall pick.Lance threw for 120 yards and two touchdowns, and the Los Angeles Chargers beat the Detroit Lions 34-7 in the Hall of Fame game that kicked off the NFL’s preseason Thursday night.The game opened with a moment of silence for the four people killed earlier this week by a shooter who was targeting league headquarters in New York.The gunman also wounded a league employee in the shooting Monday night. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told NBC he visited the employee for an hour on Wednesday and said the man was improving.There was increased security around Tom Benson Stadium and the Pro Football Hall of Fame village.Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery, Penei Sewell and the rest of Detroit’s star-studded offense didn’t see any action against Los Angeles.Coach Dan Campbell’s Lions, who went one-and-done in the playoffs last season after winning a franchise-record 15 games, also sat their top two draft picks.Justin Herbert was among many of the Chargers starters rested by coach Jim Harbaugh, who led the team to a six-win turnaround and a playoff berth in his first season. Rookie running back Omarion Hampton, a first-round pick, carried twice for 9 yards.The Chargers recovered a fumble on the opening kickoff at the Lions 28 and converted the short field into a 7-0 lead.Lance made a perfect touch pass on fourth-and-2 to Will Dissly, who caught a 5-yard touchdown over a defender’s outstretched hand.After undrafted rookie cornerback Nikko Reed stepped in front of Kyle Allen’s sideline pass and returned it 60 yards to the Lions 6, Kimani Vidal ran in from the 2 to make it 14-0.Allen threw another pick on the next possession to Tony Jefferson after driving the Lions to the Chargers 23.Craig Reynolds’ thee-yard TD run cut Detroit’s deficit in half.But Lance fired a 19-yard pass to Tucker Fisk to the Lions 19 and connected with KeAndre Lambert-Smith on a 15-yard TD pass for a 21-7 halftime lead.Lance has started just five games in four NFL seasons after playing in only 19 games at North Dakota State. He spent just two seasons with the 49ers, who selected Brock Purdy with the last pick the same year they traded three first-round picks and a third-rounder to move up to get Lance.After two years with Dallas, Lance joined the Chargers to compete with veteran Taylor Heinicke for the backup job. He completed 13 of 20 passes before giving way to rookie DJ Uiagalelei.Allen and Hendon Hooker are battling for the Lions’ backup job behind Goff. Allen was 9 of 14 with two picks. Hooker, a third-round pick in 2023, has thrown nine passes in his first two seasons.Detroit’s sloppy special teams turned it over again in the third quarter. Jakobie Keeney-James dropped a punt inside the 10 and the Chargers recovered at the 5. But Los Angeles had to settle for Cameron Dicker’s 23-yard field goal.The Chargers capped the scoring on Vidal’s two-yard TD run late in the fourth quarter.Lions star edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson told NBC in the second half he can’t wait for Week 1 against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.Hutchinson had seven and a half sacks in five games last season before he went down with a leg injury.Before the game, Hutchinson spent time signing autographs for Lions fans who made the trip.Dicker, who was 39 of 42 on field goals last year and 9 of 11 from 50 yards or beyond, hit the left upright on a 50-yard try. He made his next two field goals.Cornerback Eric Allen, defensive end Jared Allen, tight end Antonio Gates and wide receiver Sterling Sharpe will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday."

Do we feel the same way now?Australia is a very different team to what they were the last time they competed for this trophy. Their fundamental core has shifted. Injuries and retirements have forced the side to figure out the next version of themselves, and nobody is quite sure what it looks like yet.Partly because the past 12 months under interim coach Tom Sermanni, the last coach to win this tournament for Australia back in 2010, was a year of stasis. With Football Australia taking far too long to appoint a successor to Tony Gustavsson, the team wasted several windows trotting out their tired senior players for friendlies when they should have been blooding the next generation instead.So who are the Matildas now? They’ve lost some older players, gained some newer ones. The form of some key figureheads – Kerr, Fowler, Katrina Gorry – remains uncertain. The team’s recent performances haven’t been convincing. Are they any better or any worse than they were four years ago? Just how quickly has Asia improved around them?Joe Montemurro, who took charge of his first camp earlier this month, now has just three windows left to figure it out. And they will have the hot spotlight of the nation upon them as they try to solve their past problems against the hardest group of the tournament.Their opening match against the Philippines in Perth on 1 March may seem like an easy one on paper. Australia have won all their previous matches, including an 8-0 drubbing in October 2023.But this is a nation with a plan: led by Australian Mark Torcaso, the Filipinas are full of international diaspora, particularly from the USA college system. Their gallant World Cup performances, an ever-improving youth pipeline, and a large fan community could prove trickier than anticipated.Iran, too – the lowest-ranked side in the group – are no push-overs. While the Matildas have met them just once, Iran defended brilliantly and kept them to just a 2-0 win. Their defeat of rising Asian nation, Jordan, in the final round of qualifiers shows a side steadily improving, and knowing Australia’s age-old struggle to break down deep-lying defensive teams, could pose a problem.But it’s South Korea that will cause the most concern. Never mind that the Matildas defeated them in two friendlies back in April; tournament football is a different fight, and South Korea, who reached the final in 2022 before losing to China, know how to grind through them. The shadow of India will stretch across this must-win group game.South Korea is also a nation that is moving on. Just three of their most recent call-ups have had over 100 caps, while half their current squad is aged below 25. That includes 21-year-old striker Jeon Yu-Gyeong, who stood alongside the 34-year-old Yallop on stage at last night’s draw. Two players representing two very different moments for their national teams.Australia aren’t without their glimpses of the future, though. Amy Sayer, Winonah Heatley, Teagan Micah, Charlie Grant, Jamilla Rankin and Holly McNamara have all begun to show their qualities in the vacuum of senior stars.And squad depth – as we’ve seen in the recent Women’s Euro – could be critical to topping the group, thus avoiding some of Asia’s biggest nations until World Cup qualification (which this tournament doubles as for the final time) is secured in the semi-finals.But with time slipping away and the Matildas’ older core needing to reintegrate following a period of directionless wandering, is there enough time to do what needs to be done?Next year’s Asian Cup will be a lot of things. A television spectacle, a commercial achievement, a moment in sporting history. It will also be a crucial litmus test; a chance to see just how far the Matildas have come – or, if the ghosts of their past still haunt them, how much further they have to go."

    "content": "Summer McIntosh came within a whisker of breaking a long-standing world record and Léon Marchand failed to improve on a new mark he set just a night earlier, but both young guns won gold medals at the world championships in Singapore on Thursday.Romania’s David Popovici also flirted with a record on day five at the World Aquatics Championships Arena, the 20-year-old claiming a thrilling 100 metres freestyle gold to go with his 200 crown on day three.The 200 butterfly world record of 2:01.81 set by China’s Liu Zige in 2009 is the last surviving mark from the supersuit era in women’s swimming – and McIntosh all but took it down.She stormed to her third individual gold medal of the meet in 2:01.99, the second-fastest swim of all time and a yawning three seconds better than American silver medallist Regan Smith.Having made the last turn under world record pace the Canadian 18-year-old flagged slightly coming home and shouted an expletive when she spied the clock.“I know that I messed up the last 15 metres of my race,” she said. “Overall, happy with the time and a PB, but I didn’t reach my goal tonight.”China’s 12-year-old marvel Yu Zidi finished just off the podium again having also placed fourth in the 200 IM.McIntosh might console herself in the knowledge that her bid for five individual titles remains intact, with the 400 IM and a hugely anticipated showdown with American great Katie Ledecky in the 800 freestyle still to come.Only Michael Phelps has won five individual golds at a world championships.Marchand, dubbed the French Phelps\", celebrated a world record on Wednesday when he blitzed the long-standing 200 IM mark of Ryan Lochte with an incredible swim of 1:52.69 in the semi-finals.With victory seemingly assured in the final the only suspense was whether Marchand might reset his world record from the previous night but he ended up nearly a second short, with a time of 1:53.68.It was still the second fastest swim ever and led to a dominant win by 0.62 seconds ahead of American Shaine Casas and Hungarian Hubert Kos. Marchand said the record may have taken a bit out of him but he was hardly complaining.“I felt so excited yesterday that I couldn’t sleep,” he said. “So I think I lost a lot of energy yesterday night, but it was my goal to break the record, so I was really happy with it.”Popovici doublePopovici then emerged the winner of a sensational men’s 100 freestyle final, clocking 46.51 to give Pan Zhanle’s world record (46.40) a big scare.American runner-up Jack Alexy also broke the 47-second barrier (46.92), while Paris Games silver medallist Kyle Chalmers took the bronze for Australia.At 20, 200 Olympic champion Popovici has already completed the 100-200 sweep twice at world championships, having done the double at Budapest three years ago.The relaxed Romanian said he had reached a higher plain; no longer worried about winning or losing.“I just feel very relieved that this huge pressure of being afraid of winning or losing is off me,” he said.“I don’t mean it in an arrogant way, I mean it in a self-maturing way.“The United States celebrated a fourth gold in the meet as Katharine Berkoff won the 50 backstroke in 27.08 seconds, edging compatriot Smith.In the finale of Thursday’s programme, Australia’s women clinched a second relay gold as Mollie O’Callaghan held off Ledecky in a thrilling final leg to guide her 4x200 freestyle relay team over the finish line.Australia also won the men’s and women’s 4x100 freestyle golds on Sunday.O’Callaghan, whose 11th gold tied her with Ian Thorpe as the most successful Australian at the world championships, will now look to add the 100 freestyle title to her 200 crown on Friday.Medals will also be decided in the men’s 200 breaststroke, 200 backstroke and 4x200 freestyle relay, as well as the women’s 200 breaststroke."

    "content": "Australian swimmer Mollie O’Callaghan’s golden touch has continued with an emotional victory at the world championships in Singapore.O’Callaghan collected gold in the women’s 200m freestyle on a Wednesday night when Australia’s fortunes fluctuated.Kyle Chalmers laid down an ominous marker for the men’s 100m freestyle final and rookie Harrison Turner won bronze in the men’s 200m butterfly – Australia’s first medal in the event at a world championships.But compatriot Sam Short’s torrid run at major tournaments continued when the gold medal hopeful was forced to withdraw from the men’s 800m freestyle final because of gastro illness.He suspects food poisoning from lunch at the team hotel, but Swimming Australia said the source had yet to be established.Short’s Olympics last year were upset by illness and injury and the 21-year-old was hoping his fortunes had changed in Singapore when winning silver in in the 400m freestyle on the opening night.His disappointment at not making the blocks was in stark contrast to O’Callaghan’s joy at her 200m freestyle gold.O’Callaghan triumphed in one minute 53.48 seconds with teammate Jamie Perkins (1:56.55) finishing seventh.“Heading into this week has been a whirlwind,” O’Callaghan said.“Having a big long break after the Olympics was well needed and then coming back from injury myself, I am so thankful to have an amazing coach [Dean Boxall] to guide me through this difficult time.“I know it has been hard for a lot of people to come back after the Olympics but I am very grateful to have a good support from the team to get me through this mentally and physically.”Chalmers was fourth fastest into Thursday night’s 100m freestyle medal race.The 27-year-old clocked 47.36 seconds in his semi-final – quicker than his 2016 Olympic gold medal swim and also faster than his silver medal effort at last year’s Olympics. American Jack Alexy (46.81) topped the semi-final times.And the Dolphins medal tally received an unexpected boost when 21-year-old Turner snared bronze in the men’s 200m fly.The 21-year-old former cross-country athlete snuck into the final in lane eight and then produced an Australian record of 1:54.17 in a race won by American Luca Urlando (1:51.87).“I looked up on the board and I had to look there for a bit. I was like: ‘Does it say third?’,” Turner said. “It’s just unreal.”Australia’s mixed 4x100m medley team of Kaylee McKeown, Nash Wilkes, Matt Temple and Milla Jansen finished fifth.Also on Wednesday night, French star Leon Marchand broke the men’s 200m medley world record.Marchand clocked 1:52.69 in a semi-final, well inside American Ryan Lochte’s previous benchmark of 1:54.00 set in 2011.Meanwhile at the diving world titles held concurrently in Singapore, Australian duo Cassiel Rousseau and Maddison Keeney won silver in the mixed 3m springboard synchro on Wednesday night.The silver was Keeney’s second medal of the championships after winning 1m springboard gold last Saturday."

    "content": "Sitting in a car wash with the windows jammed open would be marginally drier than walking the streets of Sydney this week. The forecast rain stayed away for the decisive second Test in Melbourne, but the outlook for the Accor Stadium on Saturday is properly damp. Not that the Lions are overly bothered as they seek to squeeze every last drop of joy out of their tour of Australia.From the moment they met up the mantra of this party has been based on showing the absolute best of themselves in the Test matches and winning the series 3-0. Nothing has changed in that regard, as reflected in Farrell’s largely rinse‑and-repeat final-Test selection, with the exception of Blair Kinghorn and James Ryan being elevated to the starting XV and a forward-loaded 6-2 bench split.As anyone with knowledge of Farrell’s competitive instincts will be aware, the chances of him easing off the downcast Wallabies at this late juncture were always on the nonexistent side of slim. A final flourish is not always easily achieved at the end of a long, punishing season, but, in this case, all the most influential Lions are fit and hungry and motivation is not a problem.Aside from enjoying each other’s company, the players have also responded well to Farrell’s management style, among the primary reasons why this large tour party has stayed fully united. “He’s been really good at getting everyone closer,” said the Scotland centre Huw Jones, set to become a member of a prestigious Lions club by starting all three Tests. “I don’t really know how he’s done it, but it’s worked.“I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the outside. He’s very calm and relaxed a lot of the time, [but] when he’s on, he’s pretty intense. When we’re training he’s always on and doesn’t miss a beat. He sees everything and he’s prepared to call you out in the middle of the session if something’s not good enough.“There’s no hiding place, his standards are so high. He’s very clear about what he wants and how he wants you to do it. He’s been brilliant and it’s great to be part of the squad under that leadership.”Jones, who will again partner Bundee Aki in midfield, was also good value on the subject of Farrell’s presence and rugby instincts. “He doesn’t need to try to be intimidating, he just is. Some people just have that presence. He’s obviously massive. Without meaning to be, he’s just an intimidating person. Not in a bad way, but in a good way that commands respect. When he speaks everyone is listening. I’m yet to hear him say something I don’t agree with, he reads the game so well.“If you are walking, haven’t quite got into position or if you are not talking to someone he will pick it up … and you will know about it. It is about not accepting anything average or mediocre you may be able to get away with at your club. We are here because we were selected as being the best of our international teams. You have to show up and prove that every day.”A resounding final performance, accordingly, is the objective of all concerned, Farrell included. When he says winning 3-0 “would mean the world to us” he is reiterating his belief that aiming high is vital, in sport and life.“I never think you should shy away from shooting for the stars because you might end up on the moon,” he said. “That’s pretty good as well.“What’s there to be shy about? Players, coaches, staff, Lions fans, everyone … they all want to win every game. You can’t be frightened of that.”Just as telling, perhaps, is that even the 16 unlucky individuals – 12 original selections and four replacements – who have had no involvement in the Tests have felt as much a part of campaign as the 27 who have. “It touches you,” said Farrell. “The ones that were celebrating most last Saturday were the ones who hadn’t put the shirt on. That says it all.”All that remains, then, is for the chosen few to go out and apply the coup de grace. In the first half in Brisbane and the second half in Melbourne these Lions have shown what they can do; not so much at other times. On this occasion, Farrell would settle for 70 minutes of excellence that, on the evidence to date, should be enough: “We know what we’re capable of in all sorts of areas, so getting close to eight or nine out of 10 in all of them would be somewhere close to where we want to be.”Jones feels much the same as he prepares for his own final fling. “We’ve probably not played to our full capacity yet. That’s been the message this week: to try and have our best performance of the tour. To do it in the last game, to win 3-0 – that would be amazing. That’s where the motivation is.”It takes more than a spot of rain to dilute the resolve of Farrell and co."

    "content": "The timing could not have been better for Todd Greenberg, the new chief executive of Cricket Australia. The month before he settled into his Jolimont office in March this year, his associates at the England and Wales Cricket Board did him an extraordinary favour. Their process to sell minority stakes in teams playing in The Hundred, the short-form franchise cricket competition similar to the Big Bash League, raised £520m ($1.06bn).Greenberg – the respected former NRL and Australian Cricketers’ Association CEO – followed Nick Hockley in the role. But while the position as one of the figureheads of Australian sport came with prestige and power, Greenberg was also restricted by the actions of his predecessor.The extension of the local broadcast deal with Foxtel and Channel Seven was signed by Hockley in 2023 amid strained relations between the sport and its free-to-air partner. Whether the roughly $215m per year arrangement was fair value or not, Greenberg came into the role handcuffed: cricket’s single biggest revenue line item was locked in until 2031.Seeking options – more so-called “financial levers” – at the start of his tenure as CEO, Greenberg acted quickly following the The Hundred sale process. Alongside chair Mike Baird, Greenberg commissioned CA’s long-time consultants of choice, Boston Consulting Group, to assess the best paths of growth for the BBL.The recommendations of that report were revealed on Tuesday in the Sydney Morning Herald, and include selling a minority stake in the eight BBL teams to private investors. Whether it came from a genuine leak, or a plant by CA to test public support for the controversial proposal, the news has been hailed by proponents of private investment.Cricket Australia addressed the speculation on Wednesday, confirming the recommendations included optimising the schedule and increasing the salary cap to attract top players, the potential for expansion, and private investment.Baird said although “no decisions have yet been made”, work is now under way alongside cricket, commercial and broadcast partners “to consider the recommendations on how this value can be unlocked”.Player agent and cricket dealmaker, Neil Maxwell, believes the opportunity not only provides access to capital but also new investors’ business acumen and networks. “It shouldn’t have taken this long,” he says. “The BBL has built a decent product, initially it was a second mover [after the IPL], and it had that advantage over other leagues, but it set itself back by not keeping pace with commercial reality. The major factor there is it hasn’t been able to compete internationally through one of the main products that people require, and that’s access to the best players.”Private equity in the BBL has been considered since 2010, before a ball in the new competition had been bowled. At that time, the CA’s head of strategy was Andrew Jones, who now works as a management consultant. A decade later, Jones wrote an article in The Age describing the period titled: “There is always free cheese in a mousetrap”.The “free cheese” in a private equity deal is the up-front investment. The “mousetrap” is the money, control and strategic flexibility lost forever. Selling BBL stakes to private investors was “the single worst idea in my time in cricket,” Jones wrote in 2021. “Not much has changed.”Since 2021 however, IPL team valuations continue to rise, and a sale of the Gujarat Titans this year pegs the team at around $1.3bn. There has been increasing investment in franchise T20 leagues such as those in South Africa and the UAE, which compete against the BBL in its traditional summer school holiday window.Eric Windholz, associate professor in Faculty of Law at Monash University and an expert in sports law says CA “would be derelict in their duties” if they were not monitoring these global trends. “It’s only natural that the authorities in charge of cricket in Australia are looking at what’s happening around the world and properly investigating what are the opportunities for cricket here,” he says.But he noted public sentiment remained sceptical about private equity’s benefits. “We, the public, feel like we own the sport, so whenever we hear about private equity coming in to own an asset that we think we own, we obviously have an unease about it,” he says.Greenberg appeared to address those who might be uncomfortable with the notion with his comments on Wednesday, when he said “any action we take achieves this potential and is in the best interests of Australian cricket and cricket fans”.Some of that discomfort may be alleviated by the release of more information about the proposed BBL deals. Selling 49% of a franchise will be too large a share for some states to stomach, even if they retain majority control of an entity valued as high as six figures. The franchises will also require veto rights over the investors. The Adani Group, which had interest in the recent Gujarat Titans sale process, buying a stake in Brisbane Heat is unlikely to go down well.But there are also competing views over how any capital injection would be spent. Under The Hundred’s sale, 10% of the revenue was quarantined for grassroots cricket, with the rest split between the counties and the MCC. Much of that money appears set to be used to prevent the collapse of some counties, and reduce hundreds of millions of pounds in debt.Cricket Australia lost $32m in 2023-24, but its cash reserves are set to rise to around $70m after the coming Ashes Tour, largely thanks to the success of red ball cricket. At this stage at least, the sport doesn’t need external funding to help prop it up.Some within cricket believe a proportion of any private equity windfall should be placed in a so-called “future fund” to deliver market returns long into the future, or to provide security for the next pandemic. Some look at the diversified assets of the NRL, which has bought into real estate in recent years, with envy. Others have raised the prospect of infrastructure upgrades within the sport. All agree that at least some needs to be spent on the BBL, to attract more prominent players and improve its global standing.Yet there is concern that cricket’s diverse stakeholders may make competing claims on any newfound riches, and turn a once-in-a-lifetime investment injection into a short-term sugar hit. Maxwell, as a player agent, believes athletes must be better paid, but only as part of a broader plan for growth. “It’s not ‘pay the players and then build a strategy’, it’s the other way around,” Maxwell says. “The players fill that gap and they support that strategy.”Windholz agrees there are positives in having an injection of private capital, “but the owners of the private capital aren’t doing this out of the goodness of their hearts,” he says. “They want a return on their investment, and that’s where the risk lies.”"

    "content": "The Wallabies will take inspiration from retiring scrum-half Nic White as they seek to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test against the British & Irish Lions in Sydney on Saturday.The veteran announced on Thursday he would retire from international rugby after Saturday’s Test and coach Joe Schmidt has handed him the No 9 jersey for his 73rd Wallabies cap in a nod to his long contribution to Australian rugby.White said it was the right time to “pass on the baton” to players like Jake Gordon and Tate McDermott, who have played ahead of him in the first two Tests.“Pulling on the gold jersey was a dream of mine when I was a young boy in Scone and to say I’ve done it 72 times, with one last crack on Saturday night, is something I’m incredibly proud of and a privilege I’ve never taken for granted,” White said.“Rugby has given me so much to be grateful for. I’ve made some incredible memories, some lifelong friendships and had the opportunity to see the world.”Schmidt described White as “the ultimate competitor”. “First and foremost Nic is a great man to have in a squad,” he said. “He’s team first all the time and has been at the top of the game for over a decade.”Outside White, Tom Lynagh at flyhalf and the centre pairing of Len Ikitau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii keep their places, while Dylan Pietsch will replace the injured Harry Potter on the wing.There are more changes in the forwards, as tighthead prop Taniela Tupou replaces Allan Alaalatoa who is out with a shoulder complaint.Rob Valetini will miss the game as the staff manage his return from a calf injury, after he lasted only 40 minutes in Melbourne.Into the loose forwards comes Tom Hooper to play alongside Queensland pair Fraser McReight and Harry Wilson who was again named captain, and prop Zane Noongar has been brought on to the bench.Carlo Tizzano and Tom Robertson have dropped off the bench, which has a five-three split including the recalled Andrew Kellaway.Schmidt said the squad has been “deflated” after the “gut-wrenching” end to the Test in Melbourne, when a contentious last-minute try won the Lions the match and the series, but they have now put that experience behind them.“They have started to gather momentum in the back half of the week and will be ready to go again on Saturday,” he said.“The support in Brisbane and Melbourne helped to lift the squad, and I know the support this weekend in Accor Stadium, will again help to lift the players in the high-pressure moments that we know are coming.”The 83,000-capacity stadium is sold out for the clash, as the Wallabies hope to avoid their first whitewash against the Lions since 1904.Wallabies: 15-Tom Wright, 14-Max Jorgensen, 13-Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, 12-Len Ikitau, 11-Dylan Pietsch, 10-Tom Lynagh, 9-Nic White, 8-Harry Wilson, 7-Fraser McReight, 6-Tom Hooper, 5-Will Skelton, 4-Nick Frost, 3-Taniela Tupou, 2-David Porecki, 1-James SlipperReplacements: 16-Billy Pollard, 17-Angus Bell, 18-Zane Nonggorr, 19-Jeremy Williams, 20-Langi Gleeson, 21-Tate McDermott, 22-Ben Donaldson, 23-Andrew Kellaway"

    "content": "Nothing short of the Melbourne Vixens’ best will be enough to stop the West Coast Fever juggernaut in Saturday’s Super Netball grand final, according to retiring coach Simone McKinnis.The Vixens are determined to send McKinnis, who is stepping down after 13 years at the helm, out as a winner but face a mighty task in toppling the Fever, who are on a 13-game winning streak.In their two clashes through the season Melbourne haven’t come close, but after fighting their way from fourth to a spot in the decider at a sold-out Rod Laver Arena, the Vixens believe they can cause a boilover against the runaway minor premiers.The Vixens fortuitously have a home grand final thanks to Netball Australia selling off the match to the highest bidder, which the Victorian government won last September.The Vixens suffered a two-goal loss in last year’s grand final in Adelaide against the Thunderbirds, with their last title coming with a victory against the Fever in 2020, when the title showdown was played in a Queensland hub due to Covid-19.McKinnis acknowledged it would be tough but not impossible to stop the Fever, who won their last grand final meeting in 2022, and in particular Jamaican sharp-shooter Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard.They have been boosted by the return of star wing attack Hannah Mundy, who has been sidelined for more than a month with a foot injury but got the green light this week.“We have to be at our absolute best, individually and collectively as a team and I think that anything bar that is not going to cut it,” said McKinnis, a former Diamonds wing defence.“We have to have real clarity and intention about what we’re doing out there, we have to put them under as much pressure as we can and we have to go for it back ourselves in attack. Tough ask, but I believe we can do it.”Fever coach, Dan Ryan, said his team’s preparation had been seamless as they sat back and watched the Vixens claw their way from a 10-goal three-quarter time deficit to oust the NSW Swifts in the preliminary final.The Perth outfit beat the Vixens in the final round of the season by 11 goals with Fowler-Nembhard slotting a stunning 60 goals with her only blemish missing two long-range super shots.But Ryan said they were far from a one-player team.“To win this competition every single player needs to pull their weight and do their role and every role is slightly different and we’ve got a team of 10 that we have great confidence to turn to at any point in time,” he said.“Jhaniele is obviously a focal point for us, and she’s always a focal point in opposition gameplans as well, but we really back in every position on the court to bring out the best in each other and support each other on that court.“It’s been a really good two-week build to the game … there’s a great energy amongst the group and confidence and excitement to get out there and hopefully play some great netball.”"

However, the world champion did not confirm he would see out the rest of his contract with Red Bull that runs until 2028.Verstappen was known to have been involved in talks with the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, who has made no secret of his desire to persuade the four-time world champion to join the Silver Arrows, and Verstappen’s future has been under immense scrutiny of late.At this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, the Dutchman unequivocally declared his immediate future would be at Red Bull.“It’s quite interesting to follow all that [speculation] and the amount of nice stories that came out of it,” he said. “But I’ve never really said anything about it because I was just focused on talking to the team about how we can improve our performance, future ideas for next year as well.“But it’s time to stop all the rumours and I’ve always been quite clear that I was staying anyway. That was also the general feeling in the team because we were always in discussions about what we could do with the car. When you’re not ­interested in staying then you also stop ­talking about these kinds of things and I never did.”Verstappen has been dissatisfied with the fall in performance Red Bull have experienced in the past 18 months. He managed to convert an early lead last season into his fourth title, but the expected improvement over the winter failed to materialise and Red Bull have been left behind by a dominant McLaren.A number of new regulations come into play next season, ­including a ­radical engine change. It could ­represent a reset of form across the grid, with Red Bull ­taking a major step into the unknown by building their own power units for the first time.­Notably, Verstappen declined to say he would see out his contract beyond 2026, when he would have a better idea who had made the best interpretation of the new regulations. When asked if he could expect speculation about his future again next year, he said: “If you ask me that question next year, then yes,” he said. “I never speak about it. Because I’m more interested in just working on the performance of things. That’s why I also never really talk about what is in my contract.”It is understood Verstappen had an exit clause in his contract that allowed him to leave if he was outside the top three at the summer break this season. After finishing fourth in Spa and with 28 points in hand over fourth-placed George Russell he cannot meet that criterion when the break begins after the Hungarian Grand Prix.Verstappen has long since ­conceded his shot at the title has gone and has made clear his displeasure at his car’s shortcomings. Three weeks ago, immediately after the British GP, Red Bull dismissed Christian Horner, their team principal of 20 years, in what was seen as the final move in a longstanding power struggle between Horner and Red Bull’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH. Horner was replaced by the former Racing Bulls team principal Laurent Mekies. Keeping Verstappen at the team was considered a key factor in the change instigated by management and this week the Red Bull head of motorsport, Helmut Marko, noted that the lack of performance had been central to the reasons behind Horner being removed“It was the result of various factors but primarily performance was not quite where it should be,” said Marko. “Luckily, we were able to bring in Laurent Mekies from within the Red Bull family. His role will be significantly more focused – primarily on racing.”The latter a pointed note, an indication that with Horner’s role as team principal and CEO there was a belief he had perhaps lost focus on what Verstappen considered the most important task: delivering a quick car.That Verstappen has finally publicly confirmed he will remain with the team may be interpreted by many as a vindication of the removal of Horner, despite the upheaval it caused. The internal wrangling certainly has been brought to a close and Verstappen declared himself happy with his new boss.“Of course, it’s still very early days, but I do like how Laurent is working,” he said. “Very motivated, constantly asking the right questions to me, but also to the team. It’s nice to see.”Meanwhile, Russell, whose place at Mercedes had been considered at risk had Verstappen jumped ship, is believed to be close to finalising his new contract with the team. “Conversations have started, we are now heading into the summer break,” he said. When asked if it was now only a question of how his contract would look, the British driver replied: “Yes, I guess so”."

    "content": "Blair Kinghorn and James Ryan have been named to start for the British & Irish Lions in their third Test against the Wallabies in Sydney on Saturday as Andy Farrell’s side seek to wrap up a series whitewash.Kinghorn is selected on the left wing with James Lowe dropping out of the 23 while Ryan replaces Ollie Chessum, who has been named on the bench. Kinghorn impressed as a replacement in the last-gasp victory in Melbourne last week and though he is a fullback by trade, he often appears on the wing for Toulouse.Ryan also caught the eye off the bench at the MCG and comes into the starting XV alongside Maro Itoje, who continues as captain. Ryan is one of nine Ireland players selected along with Tadhg Furlong who will equal Alun Wyn Jones in starting nine consecutive Tests for the Lions. Itoje will also appear in his ninth straight Lions Test, having made his debut off the bench in New Zealand in 2017.Lowe pays the price for indifferent form in the first two Tests but Farrell has resisted making wholesale changes to his side which will bid to become the first to complete a series whitewash since 1927 and the first to go unbeaten since 1974. It means that Sione Tuipulotu again misses out with Bundee Aki and Huw Jones keeping their places in midfield.It is unclear whether Joe McCarthy was deemed fit to play, having missed the second Test with a foot injury, but Ryan is rewarded for his form of late after a slow start to the tour. On the bench, Owen Farrell is again selected as part of a 6-2 split with Ben Earl also recalled, having missed out in Melbourne.Up front Furlong is joined by Leinster teammates Dan Sheehan and Andrew Porter again while Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry and Jack Conan keep their places in the back-row. Jamison Gibson-Park and Finn Russell are again the halfbacks while Tommy Freeman stays on the right wing and Hugo Keenan is once more named at fullback after his last-minute try sealed the series win last week.On the bench, Ellis Genge, Ronan Kelleher and Will Stuart again provide front-row cover while Chessum, Jac Morgan and Earl complete the forwards contingent. Joining Farrell among the backs is Alex Mitchell, who has now been named in every squad on the tour.“We have put ourselves in a great position to finish this Tour with our best performance to date and create our own piece of history,” Andy Farrell said. “Last weekend’s Test match in Melbourne was an incredible spectacle and illustrated how special Lions Tours are and what they mean to both the players and the supporters. We are expecting another epic battle this weekend against a Wallaby side that showed their quality last week.”"

    "content": "This was anything but the kind of advert Super League clubs who voted to expand the competition to 14 teams in 2026 would have hoped for.This may well be the last time we see Salford versus Hull KR as a Super League fixture for some time. There is a growing feeling that, even with two more teams joining the elite next year, Salford’s position is increasingly untenable as they remain riddled by financial problems.Having been forced to request an advance on their central distribution on the eve of the season, a takeover in February was hoped to be the cure for their long-term ills. But 20 rounds into the season, Salford remain under salary-cap constraints, have had to sell players to make ends meet and are still in deep financial trouble.A multimillion-pound bridging loan that has long been promised by the owners has not arrived. Salford’s young players that are left are being forced to turn out every week when they are not ready for Super League, and the results are ones like these. This win for Hull KR, their biggest as a top-flight club, was a mismatch from the first minute.There is no blame attached to Salford’s young squad, who continue to apply themselves superbly in the face of such adversity, their coaching staff or those on the terraces who are passionately backing this group until the end of the season and will continue to do so whatever may come after that. It may well be life in the Championship.The blame lies with Salford’s ownership, and there is no doubting the uncertainty that has lasted so deep into the season is causing reputational damage to the club, but also to Super League. It was a point not lost on the Hull KR coach, Willie Peters.He said: “I’m not sure what to feel because the situation Salford are in is not good. I feel for [Salford coach] Paul Rowley, the players and the fans who are turning up every week. Some people have got to be held accountable because it’s embarrassing for our game over here. It does not help anyone.”Having watched his side concede 14 tries, Rowley appeared emotionally drained. He said: “I’m not sure what the emotion is. I’m bored of it, I’m sick of it. We just want to compete. It’s not what we want to see. We’re sad at the situation and we’re sad for the sport because we don’t want to be in this position.”Some Super League coaches have expressed concerns there are not enough players to support 14 elite teams and while Salford have their own problems that contributed to this score, this will have done little to assuage those fears.It is worth crediting the imperious Super League leaders, though. They scored points at will here to underline the gulf between these two sides. The reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, provided an incredible eight try assists and scored one of his own, with Rovers 14-0 up after ten minutes and 34-6 ahead by the break.Any suggestion they would ease up in a show of mercy for a young Salford side was unfounded. Lewis continued to torment the Red Devils after the break, with Joe Burgess crossing for four tries in total and Peters’ men picking up their biggest ever victory as a Super League club.Their bigger challenges lie ahead, specifically the defending champions Wigan in a fortnight. As for Salford, it is unclear how much longer they will be a Super League club for but their challenges are the same as the competition itself: minimising reputational damage and convincing the public better times lie ahead."

    "content": "A high-profile meeting last week in France between LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter and Nikola Jokić’s agent Miško Ražnatović was about plans for a new $5bn international basketball league, according to a report by Front Office Sports, which cited multiple sources familiar with the matter.The proposed league, spearheaded by Carter, would feature six men’s and six women’s teams that travel together to eight global cities in a touring format. Inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, the league aims to offer players equity stakes, something NBA rules currently prohibit for active athletes.Ražnatović, a powerful figure in European basketball, posted a photo of the meeting on Instagram over the weekend. The caption, tagged in Saint-Tropez, teased: “The summer of 2025 is the perfect time to make big plans for the fall of 2026.” That photo fueled speculation about a potential team-up between James and Jokić, but sources confirmed to Front Office Sports the meeting was unrelated to the NBA.Carter began pitching the league earlier this year, with Bloomberg reporting in January that he is seeking to raise $5bn in funding. Backers already include the Singapore government, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, SC Holdings, UBS and investors such as Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice and former Facebook executive Grady Burnett.Unlike the WNBA-adjacent Unrivaled league, which allows dual participation, Carter’s venture is expected to require full-time commitments, effectively ruling out NBA participation unless league rules change.The NBA, meanwhile, is pursuing its own expansion into Europe. Commissioner Adam Silver and deputy commissioner Mark Tatum met with UK prime minister Keir Starmer in London last week to discuss plans for a Europe-based NBA league in partnership with Fiba. As part of that effort, the NBA announced that the Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies will play regular-season games in Berlin and London in January 2026.EuroLeague officials have pushed back against the NBA’s expansion talks. “We said to them, like we said publicly, we don’t believe that the new league is something that would help the market,” EuroLeague CEO Paulius Motiejūnas told the Athletic on Tuesday."

    "content": "Tadej Pogačar’s victory looked certain as he flew up Butte Montmartre for the second of three times on the Tour de France’s final stage. His lead in the race’s general classification (GC) stood at four minutes and 27 seconds over Jonas Vingegaard, more than 10 minutes clear of everybody else, and GC times had been frozen for the final stage. He had won four stages already; that he hadn’t won at least six seemed more his choice than anybody else’s. There was no need to be at the front here, to add a fifth cherry atop the ice cream, but Pogačar’s unquenchable competitive spirit demanded an attempt. He stamped on his pedals on the cobblestoned hill, scything riders off the back of the bunch. By the time he crested Montmartre, he had just four others for company.Among them were the American Matteo Jorgenson and Wout van Aert, both of Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-Bike team. Thanks to superb climbing performances and helming the deepest team in the race, Vingegaard managed to defeat Pogačar at the 2022 and 2023 Tours de France – given Pogačar’s dominance since, these Tours now feel like distant memories from an obsolete world. Back then, Visma used Pogačar’s raw aggression against him. With the knowledge that he would respond to every acceleration, Vingegaard and his teammates threw jab after jab and Pogačar exhausted himself trying to counter with haymakers.Pogačar – already an all-time-great cyclist – responded by simply eradicating any trace of weakness. In the 2024 Tour and the first 20 stages of the 2025 event, Pogačar looked invincible. He hadn’t been dropped once. Most teams didn’t even think of trying to unseat him, so pointless their resistance would be. The peloton can resemble a living thing, a giant vibrating insect with shimmering, multicolored scales. For all its beauty, no part of it stood up to Pogačar. Vingegaard was the only rider who could feasibly compete. Given how comfortably Pogačar beat him in 2024, he would need even more help from his team than before.Jorgenson intended to provide just that. It’s baked into his job title, domestique, the French word for servant. If the Tour were a battlefield, the Idaho-bred Jorgenson would be on a suicide mission to engage Pogačar for as long as possible before he inevitably met his end. Any selfish goals he may have had were irrelevant.For the first four days of the Tour, Visma riders tried to surprise Pogačar with unusually timed accelerations on the flats, on the downhills, and into fierce sidelong wind. Jorgenson, to present a credible dummy target, tried to stick as close as possible to Pogačar in the overall standings. That way, Pogačar would be obligated to follow the American’s attacks as well as Vingegaard’s, leaving him potentially overextended.Pogačar casually fended off the Visma assault while simultaneously battling Mathieu van der Poel, a far heavier, more natural sprinter, in short dashes to the line. Van der Poel won their first duel on Stage 2; outsprinting him appeared a bridge too far for even Pogačar. All of two stages later, Pogačar exacted revenge. Vingegaard was behind in the sprints, but managed to stay eight seconds behind Pogacar through four stages, and Jorgenson 19. Visma’s plan had yet to produce the desired result, but hadn’t gone badly wrong either.Then on stage five’s time trial, Vingegaard and Jorgenson dropped more than one minute each to Pogačar, rendering all the efforts of the previous four days irrelevant. Stage 12’s hulking Hautacam was the most difficult climb yet; Pogačar chiseled two more minutes out of Vingegaard and 10 from Jorgenson. That was the end of any illusions that Jorgenson could be a general classification contender.With plan A vaporized, Visma tried to win individual stages. (Their Simon Yates had won stage 10, but it felt almost incidental.) On the queen stage of the race, Jorgenson stuck to the lead group, then formed a breakaway with two other riders as the rest jousted cagily at the foot of the unforgiving Col de la Loze. When Jorgenson fell back midway up the vertiginous slope, it looked like he had been instructed to wait for Vingegaard. Instead, Vingegaard’s group caught him and went past. Jorgenson was empty.Such was Pogačar’s dominance that when he grimaced in pain while following a Vingegaard attack on Mont Ventoux, I felt a genuine, if pathetic, thrill. Pogačar had shown so little mortality on the preceding stages that he had shifted the benchmarks for entertainment. In lieu of seeing him get dropped, I would accept a warped facial expression. It allowed a momentary dream of tighter competition before Pogačar whizzed clear on yet another sprint.Jorgenson’s plight seemed even direr than Vingegaard’s, who had seen his once-brilliant rivalry with Pogačar decimated by the latter’s evolution. Though he failed to land a single meaningful blow on his foe, Vingegaard’s efforts earned him praise. Jorgenson, meanwhile, disappeared silently on the slopes each day. He was emptying his reserves on stage after stage, seemingly to little effect for a hopeless purpose. With two stages left, Jorgenson admitted he had been tussling with bronchitis the previous week. What was this tall, sick man doing, trying to climb as fast as the wraiths around him?In 2023, Sepp Kuss, Visma’s most dependable domestique, rode his way into the red leader’s jersey at the Vuelta a España. Though he wasn’t the best rider on his team, it stood to reason that Visma would throw their weight behind him given his lead. They eventually did, helping ensure Kuss’ victory, but not before team leaders Vingegaard and Primoz Roglic initiated infighting that suggested they would rip the jersey from Kuss’ back if given the chance.“I had to give something up of my own ambitions to help them,” Kuss later said of his years as a domestique. “Whether they needed my help or not, I don’t know. Maybe they never did.” He laughed, but beneath the mirth is a frightening sentiment: the idea that those generous, painful sacrifices made no difference. At this year’s Tour, Jorgenson looked into a darker crisis – Vingegaard needed all the help he could get, and Jorgenson couldn’t give it.Maybe he could help someone else. With Vingegaard’s GC bid doomed, Visma aimed at securing a final stage win, likely with Wout van Aert, whose plentiful horsepower suited short, punchy climbs like Montmartre. On the flats ahead of the third trip up Montmartre’s jangly cobbles, Jorgenson began attacking the group. Pogačar followed each time, but on a slight delay. It was as if his legs needed a few seconds to overcome their fatigue before spurring into blurred motion. Though Visma’s pecking and poking throughout the Tour hadn’t resulted in any time profits, they had contributed to exhausting Pogačar. Jorgenson remained deathly loyal to that tactic. But still Pogačar had the energy to take the lead on the climb itself and further whittle down the survivors.As the top of the hill approached, van Aert suddenly thundered ahead of Pogačar, pushing his pedals so hard I could imagine the bike frame snapping beneath the strain. As van Aert sustained his violent effort all the way up, gradually, impossibly, Pogačar fell behind. Jorgenson had finally taken enough bites out of him that somebody else could draw blood, he’d shown that Pogačar still could bleed.Van Aert joyfully coasted across the finish line well ahead of the others, who, realizing the futility of chasing the rocket in front of them, had given up the chase. Pogačar rolled through the line with a finger held aloft in celebration of his fourth Tour de France victory. Jorgenson followed behind quietly, his agonizing, selfless job done and done well."

    "content": "It is rare to find such a decorated athlete – one with a regal moniker, no less – who still thrives on being the underdog. Australia’s Kyle Chalmers, “King Kyle”, has won just about everything there is to win in international swimming. Yet year after year he returns, somehow still the underdog, somehow ready to spring another upset.In recent days, at the 2025 World Aquatics Championships in Singapore, it has been more of the same. On Sunday, Chalmers anchored Australia’s relay team to an unexpected gold in the men’s 4×100m freestyle relay. On Thursday, he will go again in the individual event – the two-lap freestyle blitz, another opportunity for Chalmers to reign supreme. Arise, King Kyle, once more?The modern Chalmers story began nearly a decade ago, at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Just 18, the boy from Port Lincoln qualified for the Games at trials alongside more-fancied compatriot Cameron McEvoy. Chalmers had pedigree – he had won three gold medals at the junior world championships a year before – but this was the blue riband event of the Olympic swim meet, with a stacked field.No one gave Chalmers a chance. And yet he shocked teammate McEvoy and the swimming world to touch first in a remarkable upset, the youngest male swimmer to win an individual gold since Ian Thorpe in 2000. In less than 48 seconds, an international swim star was born.The nine years that followed have been glittering. Chalmers has won seven Commonwealth Games gold medals, six world titles and eight more Olympic medals. Now 27, Chalmers has established himself as a mainstay of the Australian Dolphins, the leading light of the squad’s male contingent.But somehow, Chalmers has always positioned himself as the underdog.In part it is because of the injuries that have plagued his career. From bulged discs to a degenerative spine, from shoulder problems to heart surgery, there has been a lengthy list of ailments. Chalmers has endured endless cortisone injections and plasma therapy; at one point he even hurt himself while lying on a couch (after a stint working as a landscaper, he said his body was not used to the rest). “And that’s just the physical side of things,” he said in Tokyo, acknowledging the mental challenges that come with such exertions.It may, in part, be explained by Chalmers always doing things his own way – contemplating swapping swimming for a career in the AFL, or working part-time as a tradie for much of his career.Certainly, in part it is his mentality. Chalmers thrives with his back against the wall, the doubt of others seems to fuel him. At the Tokyo Olympics, this reporter made a joking reference that the women had been carrying the Dolphins to glory – was it now the men’s turn? To Chalmers, it was no joke.On Sunday, at the latest edition of the world titles, the Australian men’s freestyle relay team were not expected to win gold. The Dolphins had won the event just once over the past decade; the Americans have been ascendant, winning the past three Olympic golds.But Chalmers always lifts for relays – it is no surprise a majority of his world and Olympic medals have been in team disciplines. It has so often been the scene of his heroic feats. And so again it was on Sunday; the Australians were third at the final changeover, before Chalmers powered home with a fearsome 46.53 split to finish over the top of the American rivals.King Kyle once more. But after the win, the underdog mentality was again on display. “I think it’s a huge upset, and we prove that time and time again,” Chalmers said. “Every year you read the articles and people write us off. We have a point to prove and swim with a chip on our shoulder a little bit, to be honest with you.”How many six-time world champions, nine-time Olympic medallists swim with a chip on their shoulder?On Thursday, Chalmers will contest the final in his pet 100m freestyle event, after qualifying through the heats and semi-final on Wednesday. It is shaping up to be a blockbuster clash. Chalmers won gold at the last major world championships, two years ago in Japan, but the Australian was blown away by young Chinese rival Pan Zhanle at the Paris Olympics, who shaved almost half a second off his own world record.In Singapore, Chalmers will go head to head with Romanian prodigy David Popovici and America’s Jack Alexy, who qualified fastest. Popovic is just 20; Alexy is 22. Despite only being 27, Chalmers is the field’s elder statesman, contesting his fifth world championships. Pan, another member of the next generation at 20, is a surprise absence from the final, after a lacklustre semi-final showing.Despite Chalmers’ glittering career, he has only once been world champion in the individual 100m freestyle – in 2023 – and once at the Olympic level, back in 2016 (silver in Paris behind Pan followed a heartbreaking silver in Tokyo, six one-hundredths of a second from victory).Will this be the moment King Kyle reasserts his dominance over a field of princeling upstarts? Could Olympic gold follow in Los Angeles in three years’ time? Chalmers has even floated the possibility of swimming on to Brisbane 2032, particularly following the addition of the 50m butterfly to the Olympic programme.He may not be the favourite on Thursday night. But that has never stopped Kyle Chalmers before."

    "published": "2025-07-22T14:16:43+00:00",
    "content": "The governor of the Bank of England blocked a meeting that Rachel Reeves tried to secure with watchdogs and Revolut, amid concerns the chancellor was meddling in an independent process over the fintech’s UK banking licence.Andrew Bailey intervened after learning of the plan to bring together representatives from Revolut, the Treasury and the Bank’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, to discuss the fintech’s ambitions to become a fully authorised UK bank.The three-way meeting, first reported by the Financial Times, had been due to take place in the past few weeks but was cancelled over concerns that the central bank’s regulatory decisions should be independent from government interventions and influence.A Treasury spokesperson said: “The chancellor and the governor have a strong and productive relationship, and the government fully supports the operational independence of the Bank of England.”The Bank declined to comment.The meeting would have been part of the government’s charm offensive, with ministers desperate to convince Revolut – last estimated to be worth $45bn (£33.6bn) – to choose London for its much-awaited stock market debut primary listing.Ministers have been spooked by comments from Revolut’s co-founder and chief executive, Nik Storonsky, who suggested last December that New York could be a better fit because of the regulatory environment and the size of the market.Losing Revolut, which is Europe’s most valuable private fintech, would represent a major blow to the City and the London Stock Exchange, which has suffered from a growing number of defections, with companies snubbing the UK for listings abroad.The chancellor has also been urging UK watchdogs to support financial firms in the name of growth, having gone so far as to claim in her Mansion House speech this month that regulation was acting as a “boot on the neck” of businesses.Revolut secured a limited UK banking licence last year after a rare three-year wait, having had to convince regulators it had addressed a number of accounting issues and EU regulatory breaches, as well as reputational concerns, including about an overaggressive corporate culture. The fintech company says it has since resolved those accounting and regulatory problems, and has made efforts to improve its working culture.However, the fintech was only granted a restricted licence and, 12 months on, has yet to have its application fully authorised.The restrictions mean it cannot currently offer its own loans in the UK, and while it can hold customer deposits, they are capped at £50,000. Banks are usually put under these restrictions until they can prove they have appropriate staff, IT systems and governance and accountability checks in place to satisfy officials.Revolut has been hoping to gain full approval from UK regulators this year. A fully fledged licence would open the door to new income streams, allowing it to start funding own-branded loans and mortgages.It would also mean it would face stricter regulations and make it part of the compensation scheme.A full licence was expected to be the first step in opening the door to banking licences in other countries, including the US. Revolut has already secured an EU banking licence through Lithuania.In the absence of UK approval, it has emerged that Revolut is considering buying an American bank in order to secure an American banking licence and accelerate its expansion stateside.The fintech company originally launched as a prepaid card focused on free currency exchange for customers. It has since grown to more than 10,000 staff, serving customers in more than 36 countries, with more than 50 products and services. As well as money transfers, it offers home rentals, buy now, pay later credit, wage advances, e-sims for mobile data plans and crypto trading.Its annual report in April showed Revolut more than doubled its annual profits in 2024, jumping almost 150% to £1bn, thanks to a rise in subscriptions, and revenues from its wealth and crypto trading divisions."

Had Diamond waited 14 years, presumably the response in Westminster today would be a nod of agreement.Keir Starmer’s government has embraced the City, seeing the Square Mile as a ticket to faster economic growth. It is not natural territory for Labour – but with a faltering economy, a febrile bond market to keep onside, and tight constraints on tax and spending, needs must.This month, Rachel Reeves could have been channelling Diamond in her Mansion House address. The clean-up job after the crash had gone “too far in seeking to eliminate risk”, the chancellor said. Regulation was a “boot on the neck of business” that needed lifting.The message certainly landed with the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, who met Reeves in 11 Downing Street last week. “I’m encouraged,” he told Sky. However, the head of the bank, which was once described as the “Vampire Squid”, warned the government still needed to be careful on tax and regulation. Other senior bankers, including the head of Lloyds Banking Group, have followed suit.Almost two decades on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the multibillion-pound UK taxpayer bailouts, memories of the 2008 crash are wearing increasingly thin. The banks have regrouped, and scent a Labour government prepared to consider the period of remorse is now over.To some extent, the vibe shift is justified.Britain’s biggest banks have built up significantly more capital to guard against financial shocks, have exited riskier lines of business, and City rulebooks stretching to thousands of pages are in place. Lawmakers elsewhere are considering whether risk aversion has gone too far – including in the EU, after the Draghi report.Could years of nugatory growth post 2008 be linked to overregulation? The Treasury is willing to consider the connection. For years the priority was ending “too big to fail”. Now safety limits are viewed as a millstone around the neck of the City golden goose, complicated further by Brexit trashing London’s prized status as a world-beating financial centre.It is clear to see why there is appeal in boosting the City. Britain has serious comparative advantages; London has been a global trading hub for centuries, with the legacy of empire giving it the prime spot on the meridian and use of the English language and legal system worldwide. Top universities and a vibrant startup culture help further.Financial services contribute £200bn to the economy and 5% of all tax receipts, employing more than a million people – two-thirds of whom work outside London in big regional financial centres such as Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester and Belfast. It is no coincidence Reeves describes her big bang 2.0 plan as the “Leeds Reforms” to make this point. Finance is more than just the City.The chancellor is right that a strong economy needs financing. The drying up of liquidity after the 2008 crash – when banks cut back on lending to focus on repairing their balance sheets – showed what happens when borrowing is harder for households and businesses.However, hosting an oversize financial centre with assets worth £27tn – 10 times the value of everything produced in the UK each year – has serious risks. Labour ought to know this better than most, having been on the hook in government the last time the music stopped.The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, remembers – having led the central bank’s recovery operations during the 2008 crisis. Lest we forget, he warned the Treasury committee last week: “There isn’t a trade-off between financial stability and growth. We’ve had that experience.”Back then, taxpayer guarantees worth more than £1tn were required to stop the banking collapse turning into a second Great Depression. Still, the damage was monumental: millions of businesses failed, unemployment hit 2.7 million, tens of thousands of homes were repossessed.Alongside the obvious financial stability risks for a small, open economy, the reinflation of the banking industry could also hurt the government’s other priority sectors if handled poorly.Alongside finance in the government’s industrial strategy there are seven other sectors: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital, life sciences, and professional services. All need access to growth capital, and so a strong banking sector makes sense on paper. In practice, however, there is a risk the banks use their newfound freedoms to pump more money into speculative or overseas activities.The lesson from history are not particularly encouraging.Before the 2008 crash, banks were heavily criticised for prioritising speculative activity over lending for the production of goods and services; contributing to the inflation of the biggest property market bubble in history.Mortgages still account for more than half of all UK bank lending, whereas outstanding credit to non-financial corporations – and for manufacturing in particular – is worth a pittance in comparison.Hosting mega banks servicing the needs of global investors and corporates brings valuable flows of capital into Britain, sustaining jobs and wealth creation. But there are two-sides to the coin: since the 1980s big bang Britain has suffered from a “finance curse”, or Dutch disease, as the banking sector exploded beyond a useful size for the rest of the domestic economy, crowding out other activity and stoking inequality.The danger of relying on banks to do the heavy lifting on economic growth is best summed up by the US financial sage Warren Buffett’s observation : “We were promised that a rising tide would lift all boats. [Instead] a rising tide has lifted all yachts.” For the chancellor, a City big bang is only advisable with enough checks and balances to ensure the same does not happen again.The period of remorse might be over. But 2008 should not be forgotten."

    "published": "2025-08-01T06:45:37.836140+00:00",
    "content": "On Friday, the ATO released the annual taxation statistics. These provide the data on everyone’s 2022-23 tax returns.If you love spreadsheets, you’ll love this release – one of them has 167 columns of data on everything from how many people earned “less than $0” (110,372) to how many of those who earned more than $1m had a Hecs debt (73). It also revealed that 91 millionaires paid no tax because they were able to reduce their “taxable” income to below the tax-free threshold.But as most of you are sensible and do not love spreadsheets, let me dive into them and tell you what you need to know.Negative gearing is back in styleOne of the problems for those wishing to negative gear is that record low interest rates make this rather difficult (this might have broken the record for “most Australian-first-world problem ever written”).This was the case in 2020-21 and 2021-22 when the cash rate hit 0.1%, and for the first time since John Howard introduced the 50% capital gains tax discount, the number of rental profits exceeded rental losses. But in 2022-23 interest rates rose significantly, and as a result the rental loss numbers also rose (and profits fell):If the graph does not display click hereGiven the lag of rate rises and because some investors might have been able to fix their rates for a period, I suspect this time next year the number of rental losses will rise even more.Negative gearing remains the favourite of high-income earnersI have long joked that if you were an enterprising real estate agent, you could do a lot worse than set up camp wherever anaesthetists and surgeons were holding conferences, given they are always the most likely occupations to negative gear. And so it remains – 25.5% of surgeons negatively geared a property, while 24.9% of anaesthetists did as well.If the graph does not display click hereAlmost half of capital gains go to people earning more than $1m a yearThere has been a lot of talk this year about capital gains due to the changes to the superannuation tax concessions taxing unrealised capital gains – ie the value of assets held by a person in their super funds – of earnings in balances over $3m.But for most of us capital gains are a non-entity – most of us earn our income from our salary or wages and we get taxed at the income tax rate. Capital gains however get a 50% discount if you have owned the asset for more than a year.If that feels like a rort, well, welcome to Australia’s tax system.Ninety per cent of Australians earned less than $150,000 in total income in 2022-23. That 90% earn about 72% of all the wages and salaries in Australia, but they earn just 19% of all the capital gains in Australia.By contrast, the 24,350 people who earned more than $1m a year make up just 0.2% of all individuals in the tax system, but earned 46% of all the capital gains in Australia:If the graph does not display click hereAnd when you compare the average wages and capital gains by total income range, it’s pretty clear than the very rich get most of their income from capital gains rather than wages (as well as dividends and franking credits that come from owning shares):If the graph does not display click here$3m superannuation remains a long way away from almost everyoneSpeaking of tax dodges, the tax stats also give us the latest figures for median superannuation balance by age and gender.In 2022-23, the median superannuation balance for women in their early 60s was just $153,685, while for men it was $205,385.At this point we should note that the ASFA recommends a single person having $595,000 in super to have a “comfortable retirement”. This means more than half of people nearing retirement have only around a third of money in their super to be able to retire comfortably.ASFA also suggests that for a 32-year-old to be able to have a comfortable retirement they should now have $83,000 in their super. The median balance however for people ages 30-34 is just $38,525.It really is getting a bit silly trying to argue against the changes to the tax concessions of superannuation balances above $3m:If the graph does not display click hereIf you earn more than $150,000 you are in the top 10% – and you are probably a manThe ATO rather wonderfully breaks down the incomes of all Australians into percentiles – to let you know where you sit among the rest of all the income earners in Australia.Women are very much overrepresented in the bottom half of the income scale. There are 3.52 million women in the bottom income half, but just 2.8 million men.By contrast, at the very top 1% there are 35,315 women compared with 91,160 men.The median earnings is about $70,000. Earning more than $150,000 puts you in the top 10% – and 70% of those are men:If the graph does not display click hereThe gender pay gap remains wideWhenever we hear talk about the gender pay gap it is in either hourly or weekly terms. But this hides how many hours (or days) people actually work. If a man and woman are both earning $50 an hour, but the man gets 40 hours a week, while the woman only gets 20 hours, are we really going to say there is no gender pay gap?The ATO tax stats show all – because it records how much you earn in a year, which is pretty crucial given you have to pay bills all year round, not just the weeks you earn money.And once again the difference is stark.Take for example the most male- and female-dominated occupations, plumbers and midwives:If the table does not display click hereBut perhaps we should not be too shocked that men are paid more on average in the most female-dominated occupation, because in almost all jobs men earn more:If the graph does not display click hereWhile it might be easy to suggest that this is just the way it is, a couple of examples show how things can change.Since 2016 both women’s cricket and football (across all codes) has gained much greater visibility and support, and it is clearly present in the gender pay gap. In 2016-17, women made up just 3.3% of the 2,911 people who listed “footballer” as their main occupation; in 2022-23 it was 18% – from 96 women to 537. Similarly, women now make up 36% of the 403 professional cricketers in Australia.And while men still get paid much more than women, the closing of the gap is quite stark – and something unfathomable a decade ago.If the graph does not display click hereIt’s worth remembering that gender pay gaps – just as how incomes and wealth are taxed – are not set in stone, and things can always be made more fair.

    "published": "2025-07-29T14:47:24+00:00",
    "content": "It was an opportunity for Sir Pascal Soriot, as chief executive of AstraZeneca, the UK’s finest pharmaceutical firm, to kill the story stone dead if he wished. Does he want to move the company’s stock market listing to the US, as reported by the Times a few weeks ago? He declined to answer. Then he did something else: he turned his press conference after Tuesday’s half-year numbers into a declaration of love, more or less, for all things American.“The US is the country in our industry where innovation is taking place,” he said, noting that half the group’s sales will be in the US by 2030. The new multibillion-dollar manufacturing facility in Virginia – part of a $50bn investment in the US over the next five years – had progressed to signoff in 33 days. The US administration is considering AstraZeneca’s proposals for reducing medicine prices for Americans. “We are a very American company,” said the French-Australian Soriot at one point, name-checking his various American senior colleagues.True, he also said AstraZeneca is “committed” to the UK, but he was referring directly to sites such as the £1bn research and development in Cambridge, rather than the stock market listing. An analysis followed on the failings of Europe, the UK included, versus the US and China in terms of backing pharmaceutical innovation. The US invests 0.8% of its GDP in the sector, he said, versus 0.3% in Europe. He wished the UK could aim for 0.5%, and then 0.6%, to provide a bit of competition.What to make of this (clearly) preplanned response? One could shrug and say any chief executive of a globally active pharmaceutical company would be foolish not to sing the praises of the US at a moment when its president is throwing tariffs around and has steep local drug prices in his sights. Shifting investment to the US makes sense in that context. Also, Soriot’s grumbles about Europe are not new. The specific frustrations with the UK flow from the price the NHS pays for prescription medicines plus the value-for-money rules that are applied to new drugs. Most pharma companies make similar noises on that score.Yet the stock market listing – the bit Soriot left hanging in the air – is the new angle here. It would have been a simple matter for him to say, as many other large FTSE 100 companies with large US operations do, that there is no tension between a London listing and an increased operational focus state-side. But he didn’t.The government should take note. A relisting would be expensive for AstraZeneca if it included a redomicile (and, otherwise, what’s the point?), but ministers cannot rule it out, or just assume Soriot is making a power-play as part of the industry-wide negotiations on medicine prices. The stakes here are too high for complacency. A defection by the UK’s largest quoted company would blow a hole in two government missions: firstly to inject life into the London stock market, and secondly to make the UK a “life sciences superpower”.Unfortunately, the government is also starting on the back foot with AstraZeneca after the fiasco with the £450m Speke vaccine plant in Liverpool. Accounts are disputed but the most plausible reading is that the company lost patience after the Treasury tried to shave a few million quid off the support package agreed under the last government. Whatever the details, the result was for a terrible own-goal for a “pro-growth” government.The government’s other difficulty is the lack of cash to throw at NHS medicines, the factor that may persuade Soriot to start talking enthusiastically about AstraZeneca’s British roots once again. One hopes political cogs are turning behind the scenes because something has to give. If Soriot still isn’t committing publicly to the UK listing in six months’ time, there is a big problem."

    "content": "Donald Trump has threatened to use “every tool in our arsenal” to crack down on pharmaceutical giants if they fail to cut drug prices for Americans within 60 days.The president wrote to executives at 17 companies on Thursday, demanding they match their US prices for prescription drugs with the lowest price offered in other developed nations.Current prices were an “unacceptable burden” on US families, Trump said, claiming they could be up to three times higher than in other countries.After returning to the White House earlier this year and pledging to bring down drug prices, the president claimed that “most proposals” from the pharmaceutical industry amounted to “more of the same”, accusing firms of seeking to shift blame and requesting policies that would pave the way for handouts worths billions of dollars for the sector.“Make no mistake: a collaborative effort towards achieving global pricing parity would be the most effective path for companies, the government, and American patients,” Trump wrote. “But if you refuse to step up we will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices.“Americans are demanding lower drug prices, and they need them today.”The bosses of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and GSK were among those who received the letters. GSK did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca declined to comment.Pfizer said: “Pfizer is working closely with the Trump administration and Congress on solutions that will increase access and affordability for American patients and enhance the power of the biopharmaceutical innovation ecosystem in the United States. Our discussions have been productive.”Shares in Pfizer slipped 2%, AstraZeneca fell 3.8% and GSK dropped 3.9% during afternoon trading in New York.At the heart of of Trump’s proposal is a status known as “Most Favored Nation”, through which he wants to bind the cost of medications sold in the US to the lowest prices paid elsewhere.The White House is demanding that pharmaceutical companies extend this to drugs used by older people through the government-backed Medicaid health program, as well as new drugs."

    "published": "2025-08-01T06:07:46+00:00",
    "content": "The reason why we don’t have free dental in Medicare is because we subsidise the inheritance of the wealthiest people in Australia.I know it might shock you to see it written plainly, it might even annoy you. But it is the truth.The way superannuation is mostly covered by the media in this country is about how to avoid paying tax and how to use it to fund inheritance.Take the headline this week in Nine newspapers “money column”: “We have $8m in an SMSF. How can we avoid the new super tax?”You could hardly find a more pointed example of everything wrong with Australia’s media and economic system.I look forward to the SMH and others providing advice on how people on jobseeker can work for cash to avoid losing any benefits and paying extra tax.Similarly, it doesn’t take long for any story about the proposed changes to the tax breaks on superannuation balances over $3m to mention inheritance. That’s because $3m is so far beyond what anyone needs to retire comfortably that only the most self-delusional think they need more than that to survive. Heck, the main way Peter Dutton criticised the changes was to label them a “quasi inheritance tax”.The best one of the genre is an AFR headline: “New $3m super tax is ‘stealing my children’s inheritance’”. You might expect that from the AFR but you would hope for better from the ABC.On Tuesday night, ABC’s 7.30 reported on a pair of farmers who were worried about the changes to the superannuation tax breaks because the combined balances of the couple was $5.5m and so might soon have a combined $6m (ie more than $3m each).The 7.30 story had no mention of inheritance but the written version noted that “the money isn’t only being used to fund their retirement. The plan is for it to help fund the inheritances of their other children without necessitating selling off the family farm.”Let’s stop right there.We don’t give tax breaks on superannuation so that you can fund the inheritance of your children.Tattoo that on your eyeballs.Superannuation tax breaks are designed to encourage you to save so you do not need to rely on the age pension. It is not so your kids can get a head start in life. That might be a nice thing for you to do but there is zero public benefit in giving you a tax break to do it.The story also contained the claim by the couple’s son that “Mum and Dad will be up for an extra $120,000 a year”.According to the report, the extra tax was due to the anticipated unrealised capital gain of the farming assets (the wind turbines and the agricultural chemical businesses) once the couple’s super balance passed $6m (ie $3m each).Well now. If your Spidey senses are tingling, you should be a journalist. Because that seems a rather bold claim.Consider that to pay $120,000 in tax on just plain old income you need to earn $342,000 a year.If the graph does not display click hereGiven the average tax on that is 35.1%, we know that cannot be the case for super, because super earnings are only taxed at 15% until the balance goes above $3m and then the earnings attributable to the amount above $3m are taxed at 30% – both below 35%.So, for that claim to be true, the earnings on their superannuation (including unrealised capital gains) would need to be well over $342,000.How much? Well, the Treasury has given us a handy fact sheet that lets us work it out.For one person with a $3m super balance, their fund would need to increase by $2m for them to have to pay an extra $120,000 (yes, just a 6% tax rate).But what if the $120,000 is combined?In that case, both their funds would need to grow in a year from $3m to $4.3m. Each would pay $60,035 on that $1.3m unrealised gains. Yep, a tax rate of just 4.6% each.If the graph does not display click hereConsider as well that an ordinary income earner pays an average tax rate of 4.6% when they earn just $25,500.Those with super balances of over $3m are still getting a tax break because if it was taxed like normal income they would pay 45% tax not 30%. These tax breaks cost money. Money that the government has decided it is better to spend than, for example, to include dental in Medicare.Let’s do some maths.The cost of putting dental in Medicare, which would include “preventative and therapeutic dental services, including regular check-ups and teeth cleans, crowns, orthodontic treatment, oral surgeries, periodontics and prosthodontics” is estimated by the Parliamentary Budget Office to be $13.63bn in the first year.That is a lot of money.But not compared to how much each year the government gives in tax breaks to the richest 10% on their superannuation – most of whom will not be eligible of the age pension, and thus are getting a tax break for no public good, and much of which will go towards inheritance.In 2025-26, the Treasury estimates these breaks will cost the budget $22bn.If the graph does not display click hereWhen the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was asked about dental in Medicare during the election campaign he told reporters that “we’ve got to make sure that we can afford it and make sure there’s room for it in the budget”.OK, then. Let’s not cut all the super tax concessions for the richest 10%. Let’s still give them $8bn a year in tax breaks to help ensure they have stonks more money than they need for retirement.Great, we have now found room in the budget to pay for dental in Medicare.Dental in Medicare or tax breaks to the richest so they can give money tax-free to their kids?Budget and governing are about choices, and so too is how the media covers it.

    "content": "Queensland’s Productivity Commission has flagged a broad construction industry “reset” that could threaten existing enterprise bargaining agreements, arguing it may be required if the state is to build its way out of a housing crisis – and host the Olympics.The commission released an interim report on Thursday into improving productivity in the construction sector that called on the Queensland government to permanently remove so-called “Best Practice Industry Conditions” (BPICs) from its procurement policy.Adopted under the previous Labor government in 2018, BPICs outlined construction union workers’ pay and conditions for all major state projects. Union proponents claim BPICs improved safety and lifted standards and created apprenticeship opportunities for women and Indigenous workers – industry opponents complained it led to cost blowouts and worksite shutdowns.: AU Breaking News emailThe Liberal National party deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, hit pause on BPICs in November until the re-established Productivity Commission completed its building industry review.But the interim recommendations of that review go beyond a call to permanently scrap BPICs – arguing “a broader industry reset” was required if Queensland was to “meet the needs of its growing population, match infrastructure commitments and deliver the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games”.The report cited industry stakeholders as blaming BPICs for a “a significant slowdown in site productivity on public construction” workplaces that had enabled similar conditions to “creep into the private sector through the rollout of BPICs-like conditions in [EBAs)]”.“Removing BPICs alone is unlikely to be sufficient to shift construction productivity to a growth path or improve behaviours on government construction sites,” the commission wrote.“Given that BPIC-like conditions now seem to be embedded in industry practice, including in enterprise bargaining agreements that are not due to be re-negotiated until mid-2027, it is likely that a broader industry reset is required.”Asked at a press conference after the release of the interim report if the LNP would permanently scrap BPICs, the treasurer, David Janetzki, said he would wait for the final report before making any announcements.However, the treasurer said that declining productivity “cannot be tolerated”.The Queensland Council of Unions denies that BPICs affected worksite productivity.In May it released a report it commissioned from University of Queensland emeritus professor of economics John Mangan that found post-Covid cost increases were primarily driven by global supply chain constraints and material shortages – not labour agreements or public procurement standards.The QCU general secretary, Jacqueline King, said at the time that BPICs “did not drive up costs or damage productivity” but improved safety, lifted standards and created real opportunities for apprentices, women and Indigenous workers.King said the commission’s interim report “missed the boat on the most important thing of all: people”.The union secretary said “any serious conversation about lifting productivity” in the construction industry had to start with fixing what she said was a “crisis in building and retaining a Queensland workforce”.“There’s no shortage of Queenslanders willing to work in construction but this is an industry stuck in the 1970s, with 55-hour weeks, inflexible work arrangements and poor workplace cultures driving people away,” King said.“If we are serious about addressing the skills shortage and building the housing and infrastructure we need for our ever growing population in the lead-up to 2032 and beyond, we need to focus on how to attract a homegrown labour force instead of migrant workers.”The peak national body for construction and infrastructure contracting companies backed the interim report as supporting “many of the reforms the industry has long been calling for”, including scrapping BPICs.“Queensland has a once-in-a-generation infrastructure task ahead,” the Australian Constructors Association chief executive, Jon Davies, said. “This report confirms the need for urgent reform and gives us a clear roadmap to get started”.The LNP is also pushing legislation to override more than a dozen planning laws – including heritage and environment protection laws – to build a swathe of venues for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games."

    "content": "Rolls-Royce has reported a 50% rise in half-year profits as strong demand for its jet engines and power generators for AI datacentres solidified its turnaround efforts.The British jet-engine maker said underlying operating profits climbed to £1.7bn in the first six months of 2025, from £1.1bn during the same period last year, in an earnings update that pushed the company’s shares to a fresh all-time high, and helped push the FTSE 100 share index to a new peak too.The strong half-year results meant the manufacturer, whose main operations are in Derby, was able to raise its profit forecast for the year from a range of £2.7bn-£2.9bn to £3.1bn-£3.2bn.Rolls-Royce, which makes engines used in large Boeing and Airbus planes, said its earnings were driven in part by strong demand for its large engines business. It has also been helped by the boom in weapons spending since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Rolls-Royce a key supplier of engines for fighter jets.Its power systems business had a significant increase in interest from datacentres, which the chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgiç, confirmed was linked to the boom in artificial intelligence.Orders for datacentres rose by 85% compared with last year. The company expects a 20% increase in datacentre orders every year to 2030, having forecast annual growth of 15-17% as recently as February.The results helped propel Rolls-Royce’s shares up 10.5% on Thursday morning to a record high of £11.085, driving the company’s valuation above £90bn for the first time. In October 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, its share price fell below 40p.Its valuation has nearly doubled during 2025 and it is the fifth most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange. Rolls-Royce’s rally helped to power the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares to a record intraday high of 9,190 points on Thursday morning.The company’s turnaround has been a triumph for Erginbilgiç, who ruffled feathers on taking over the business in 2023 by saying it was on a “burning platform”.Since then he has cut costs and pushed customers to pay more for its products through renegotiating contracts for maintaining jet engines that go on wide-body planes such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.The company received a recent boost from the UK government’s decision to choose it to deliver the first small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) – factory-produced nuclear power stations that aim to cut costs.Rolls-Royce said the SMR business, which it hopes could eventually be bigger than the existing revenues, should be “profitable and free cashflow positive by 2030”, before delivery of the first SMRs a couple of years later."

    "content": "Consumers are facing price rises and shortages of products from TVs and mobile phones to cars and games consoles as a global shortage in semiconductors grows.The shortage in chips, the “brain” within every electronic device in the world, has been steadily worsening since last year.Initially the problem was only a temporary delay in supplies as factories shut down when the coronavirus pandemic first hit.However, although production is back to normal, a new surge in demand driven by changing habits fuelled by the pandemic means that it is now reaching crisis point.Car manufacturers investing in tech-heavy electric vehicles, the boom in sales of TVs and home computers and launch of new games consoles and 5G-enabled mobile phones have all driven demand.Even the mighty Apple, a $2tn company and the world’s biggest buyer of semiconductors spending $58bn annually, was forced to delay the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 12 by two months last year due to the shortage.“Chips are everything,” says Neil Campling, media and tech analyst at Mirabaud. “There is a perfect storm of supply and demand factors going on here. But basically, there is a new level of demand that can’t be kept up with, everyone is in crisis and it is getting worse.”Ford recently cancelled shifts at two car plants and said profits could be hit by up to $2.5bn this year due to chip shortages, while Nissan is idling output at plants in Mexico and the US. General Motors said it could face a $2bn profit hit.Last month, Sony, which along with other console makers has struggled with stock shortages over the last year, said it might not hit sales targets for the new PS5 this year because of the semiconductor supply issue. Microsoft’s Xbox has said it forecasts supply issues continuing at least until the second half of the year.However, the most telling example of the semiconductor crisis has come from Samsung, the world’s second-largest buyer of chips for its products after Apple. Earlier this week, the company said it might have to postpone the launch of its high-end smartphone due to the shortage, despite also being the world’s second-largest producer of chips.“It is incredible that Samsung sells $56bn of semiconductors to others, and consumes $36bn of them itself, finds it may have to delay the launch of one of its own products,” says Campling.Samsung’s co-chief executive, Koh Dong-jin, who also heads its mobile business unit, highlighted a significant issue saying that there is a “serious imbalance” in the pecking order of who is getting the limited supplies of chips.Car manufacturers, who cut chip orders as vehcle sales fell last year, found themselves at the back of the queue when they tried to reorder when the market rebounded. The entire global car industry buys about $37bn worth of chips, with the biggest players such as Toyota and Volkswagen spending more than $4bn each, making them relative minnows for semiconductor suppliers.“The worst affected have been autos because they were last to the party; if Apple is spending $56bn a year and growing who are you going to keep supplies going to first?” says Campling.The chip shortage looks set to persist for some time yet. It can take up to two years to get complex semiconductor production factories up and running, and manufacturers are in the process of significantly raising prices for the second time in less than a year.“There is no sign of supply catching up, or demand decreasing, while prices are rising across the chain,” says Campling. “This will cross over to people in the street. Expect cars to cost more, phones to cost more. This year’s iPhone is not going to be cheaper than last year.”"

    "published": "2025-08-01T00:45:46+00:00",
    "content": "Jim Chalmers has reinvigorated the economic policy debate with all the talk now about his economic reform roundtable.Unfortunately, the biggest voices invariably are those who desire to help themselves. The other problem is the debate remains bounded in purposeful obfuscation. That is why it is very pleasing to read Acoss’s new report – Taxing income less and consumption more: The case against – which factchecks some myths about Australia’s tax system.Acoss provides three points that need to be the basis of any discussion of tax.Australia is a low-taxing nationIf you can’t admit Australia is a low-taxing nation, then you should not get entry into any roundtable discussion on the topic. As Acoss notes, Australia is the ninth-lowest taxing nation across all the advanced economies in the world. We raise less tax than every nation in the G7 except for the US. We raise less tax than South Korea, Canada, Japan, or the UK.: AU Breaking News emailIn 2022 (the latest OECD-wide figures) the average level of tax across the OECD was 34% of GDP, while in Australia it was just 29.4% of GDP.If the graph does not display click hereThat’s the equivalent of an extra $128bn.And sure, you might say, “that’s how it is, we can’t change that”.But we change things all the time in our tax system. Paul Keating introduced capital gains tax, John Howard introduced a 50% capital gains tax discount and the GST. We used to have inheritance taxes, and then Joh Bjelke-Petersen got rid of them in 1977:If the graph does not display click hereWe also change our spending – we haven’t always had Medicare or the NDIS. Nothing needs to only be the way it is or was.In 1970, total government tax revenue was 20.5% of GDP; within 15 years it was 27.5% of GDP – that’s a bigger shift than to go from where we are now to the OECD average.Nothing is fixed.If the graph does not display click hereAustralia is not overly reliant on income taxThe myth that we are a big income-taxing nation refuses to die.Independent MP Allegra Spender, for example, likes to say in her social media videos and tax “green paper” that “we need to lower the tax burden on working people through lowering income taxes” because we need to rebalance “tax revenue from income taxes on labour towards other sources of tax” to ensure “sustainability”.Except, as Acoss details, we are the seventh-lowest taxer of personal income in the OECD, and the 11th lowest when you include corporate income:If the graph does not display click hereAs the Acoss report notes, Australia’s “share of personal income and social security taxes is 40%, below the OECD average of 50%”:If the graph does not display click hereAustralia is less dependent on personal income taxes than every country in the G7 and yet, apparently, we need to reduce our dependency even more.Even compared with our own history we’re not all that dependent on private income tax:If the graph does not display click hereIncreasing the GST will hurt low-middle income earnersOften talk about needing to reduce our dependency on income tax is followed by a call to increase the GST. Conservative economists like to argue a GST is the most efficient tax.Caring more about tax efficiency rather than equity is rather revealing but, even still, as Acoss notes, the GST is not actually much more efficient than income tax.They note that previous Treasury research found increasing the GST to 15% and reducing income tax to compensate “would deliver negligible GDP gains”. The difference in efficiency of income tax and GST is so small that it would barely register in the overall economy.So, the only reason you would do it is if it was fairer. But, as Acoss finds, it is decidedly not so.Around the bottom 60% of households would be worse off from an increase in the GST to 15% combined with a 5% income tax cut.If the graph does not display click hereThe government could instead increase low-income benefits but, as Acoss argues, these are notoriously temporary.They note, for example, that the GST support package included “$3 per week per child family payments … together with an increase of up to $7 per week per family for sole parent families”. That was great until “seven years later, income support for sole parents with school age children was cut by $25 per week”.So where does this leave us?The problem is not dependency on income taxes but that we have overly generous income tax breaks for those who do not need them other than for reasons that have little economic basis.As Acoss argues, “tax concessions for superannuation are excessively generous for people who don’t need support to save for retirement” and similarly “capital gains tax and negative gearing concessions encourage speculation in land, undermine housing affordability and divert investment from more productive purposes”.We don’t need to increase the GST but we could broaden it to include things like private health insurance and private school fees which would actually be progressive. Some in the private school sector are already getting antsy about this (as they should).And here’s the thing – we don’t need to only fund things with more GST – we could tax wealth and better tax gas companies and all the proceeds could go into the GST bucket that the states get.There are a lot of ways to improve the tax system but, if you can’t admit the three points above, you really should admit you don’t belong in the conversation.

    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/27/trump-ira-baby-savings-plans",

    "content": "There’s Trump Mobile, $Trump coins, Trump watches, Trump sneakers and now … the Trump baby savings accounts! Will it be popular? As a financial adviser, I’m not so sure.The Trump IRA (or individual retirement account) was established as a part of the recently passed “big, beautiful bill” and aims to help young people save. Parents and employers can annually contribute up to $5,000 into an account for their kids who are under the age of 18. Within limits, the contributions are not taxed to the employee and employers even receive a deduction.What’s nice about these accounts is that the income earned as the account grows (hopefully) is also not taxed. And, different from a typical IRA, which penalizes early withdrawals, once the child hits 18 they can withdraw the funds without any penalties. The biggest bonus? For kids born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028, the government will kick in $1,000 to get things rolling.A thousand bucks? For free? Sounds good. And if you had a child this year, take advantage. Take the grand. Let it grow tax-free. At 5% interest it would be worth about $2,400 18 years from now. Why not?But that’s all I’d do. Why? Because if your intention is to save money for your kids, there’s at least two other strategies that make more sense.One is to lean into after-tax accounts like 529s and Roths.With a 529 account, you can put as much money away for your kids as you want into this after-tax account (be careful of gift tax limitations) and it will grow tax-free until the money is withdrawn. The catch is that the money has to be used for educational costs (tuition, books, fees, etc) at colleges and trade and vocational schools as well as private and religious schools. The new bill now also allows withdrawals to pay for professional certifications such as HVAC or plumbing licensing renewal courses.You can also set up a custodial Roth IRA for your child if they’re under 18. One caveat is that the child does have to have actual income (not interest or investment income) from a W-2 wage. Contributions are limited to $7,000 this year and do not reduce taxes. But all earnings are tax-free and savings can be withdrawn at any time.529s and Roths are good strategies if the goal is to pay for education or put money away for your child’s long-term future. But the strategy that I really love? Insurance. Thanks to the advice from a great insurance adviser 30 years ago, I bought whole life insurance policies for my kids. Why?The Trump IRA has nice intentions but c’mon … it’s really just a $1,000 political giveawayBecause by naming them as both the insured and the beneficiary on their policy and then paying the bill, I locked them into insanely low premiums that continue on to this day. For example, even today a $100,000 whole life policy for a newborn might cost about $30 a month. At age 30, the same policy might cost $150 a month.Buying a whole life policy for your kids also gets them tax-free payouts for their families one day if anything – God forbid – happens to them. It also builds up cash over time. A $50,000 policy bought at age five could have $20,000-plus in cash value by age 45.There are more benefits to doing this. Many policies pay dividends each year, which can provide income to the owner. And, different than a 529 plan, you can borrow against a whole life insurance policy without potentially interrupting its benefits or cash buildup as long as you continue to pay the premiums. I have some clients who buy these policies because – in most cases – it can guarantee the ability to get more insurance in the future even if there are health issues.Of course, these are just my opinions based on what I recommend to clients and what has been recommended to me. Your circumstances may be different. So run these numbers – and strategies – by your financial adviser and tailor it to your situation.The Trump IRA has nice intentions but c’mon … it’s really just a $1,000 political giveaway that at best will provide beer money for a kid once they hit 18. Sure, take it. But parents can realize a much better return on their investment by putting money away for their kids’ future education, retirement or – sorry to say – death. Do this instead of the Trump IRA and your children – and their future families – will be thanking you more."

    "content": "Turbo Tufan strikes again. It’s almost becoming predictable. Every time Tufan Erginbilgiç, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, sets “midterm” financial targets, the aero-engine maker beats them, or looks set to do so, in no time.Back in February, Erginbilgiç was able to declare that the 2027 targets for operating profits would be hit two years early, so he set new ambitions for 2028. Six months on, even the refreshed numbers look conservative. After a strong first-half, Rolls now thinks it will make £3.1bn-£3.2bn of operating profit over the whole of 2025, or about £300m more than previously advertised. At the current rate of rapid progress, it looks a short hop to £3.6bn-£3.9bn in 2028.The shares rose 8% and touched £11 for the first time. Three years ago the price was about £1. A business that required a £2bn rescue rights issue in the pre-vaccine depths of the pandemic in 2020, is now the fifth largest company in the FTSE 100 index and valued at £90bn.Naturally, Erginbilgiç’s share-based “golden hello” has followed in lock-step. To lure him from the private equity sector, he got £7.5m-worth of Rolls shares when they were 91p in January 2023. That package is now worth a cool £90m, albeit locked up in tranches until 2027 and 2028 (a reassuring detail from the point of view of shareholders).The story of how it has been done is well known by now, even if the pace continues to surprise. Erginbilgiç reorganised Rolls’ top management, removed a layer of costs, culled wasteful sidelines and, critically, invested in the reliability of the engines to allow a “win-win” renegotiation of contracts with airlines. Rolls, a company famed for years for falling short on cash generation, is now churning out the stuff.Meanwhile, markets everywhere are helpful. Demand for civil engines has fully recovered from the pandemic. The Aukus submarine partnership, where Rolls supplies the propulsion systems, underpinned the defence side even before Nato governments pledged to spend more on heavy equipment. Even the unloved power systems division has been knocked into shape in time for the age of datacentres that require backup generators.So the next question is whether the news can get any better. Can Erginbilgiç possibly maintain the pace?Well, there are two reasons to take seriously his talk about “substantial growth prospects beyond the midterm”. One is the bet on small modular reactors, or SMRs. It is still early days but the UK has ordered three and the Czech Republic six, so we will eventually discover whether these scaled-down nuclear plants can be built on time and on budget. If the answer is yes, then possibilities open up. Like the Czechs, the rest of eastern and central Europe probably wants a cost-efficient alternative to Russian gas. Power-hungry “hyperscale” datacentres in the US represent another set of potential customers.The SMR unit will be “profitable and cashflow positive by 2030”, said Erginbilgiç. Before that date, we may be asking what the operation would be worth as a spunoff, separately listed company – Rolls has a 62% stake at the moment.The other potential biggie is engines for narrow-body aircraft. Rolls is currently exclusively widebody, but its UltraFan development engine is intended to be capable of being adapted for both markets. The enormous costs mean Rolls would need a partner (the City’s guess is Pratt & Whitney), a committed airline customer and would probably demand government support. But the narrow market is much larger than the wide one – it could be genuinely transformative for Rolls.A cynical view says something always goes wrong at Rolls sooner or later, which was the experience over a couple of decades of false dawns. If there is a difference this time, it is that the company is finally producing heaps of cash, which is the real measure of success in its business. Don’t mess it up: the UK engineering sector needs a reliable world-leader."

    "published": "2023-09-03T23:01:25+00:00",
    "content": "Keir Starmer has warned businesses who persistently delay payments to their suppliers that it is “time to pay up” as the government prepares to impose fines and penalties on repeat offenders.In what Labour has billed as the toughest crackdown on late payments in a generation, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, will say on Thursday that the changes will slash a cost to the economy that has escalated to £11bn a year.As many as 38 businesses shut down each day partly owing to late payments, the government said, hurting tradespeople, shopkeepers, startup founders and family-run firms.The planned changes will include handing the small business commissioner powers to impose fines, potentially worth millions of pounds. Established in 2016 to tackle late payments, the watchdog will also be able to carry out spot checks, verify claims and impose deadlines to clear a backlog of disputes.As part of a wider Labour drive to provide more support for small businesses, Reynolds will also announce startup loans for 69,000 companies worth £4bn “to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners”.The move is backed by the prime minister and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is keen to focus on rebooting the economy after two consecutive months of negative growth and mounting speculation about tax rises.According to the Office for National Statistics, the economy contracted by 0.1% in May after a 0.3% monthly fall in April.Sir Keir said it was important for the government to support small- and medium-sized firms, which employ 60% of the workforce and generate £2.8tn in turnover.“From builders and electricians to freelance designers and manufacturers, too many hardworking people are being forced to spend precious hours chasing payments instead of doing what they do best, growing their businesses.“It’s unfair, it’s exhausting and it’s holding Britain back. So, our message is clear: it’s time to pay up.”Reynolds is expected to say legislation will include maximum payment terms of 60 days before a reduction after an introductory period to 45 days, “giving firms certainty they’ll be paid on time”.Ministers said last September that they would consult businesses about the most effective way to tackle a “culture of late payment” after several attempts by previous Tory administrations to toughen existing codes of conduct.Reynolds will say new laws were needed to give the commissioner extra powers and force large companies to be more transparent about how they pay subcontractors and suppliers.As part of the plan, audit committees will be required to scrutinise payment practices at board level, “placing greater pressure on large firms to show they’re treating small suppliers fairly backed by mandatory interest charges for those who pay late”.The small business minister, Gareth Thomas, said: “I hear all too often about businesses who just don’t have the cash needed to start up or grow. Today, we’ve announced measures as part of our plan for change to tackle all of those issues and beyond.”"

All this could mitigate ageing’s drag on growth.”Treasury’s intergenerational reports have increasingly focused the minds of Australians on the budget implications of an ageing population.As useful as these reports have been to inform the current debate around taxation reform, they may also have fed a narrative of drooling oldies who need to be propped through their autumn years by vibrant and athletic under-50s.If the IMF is right, that trite adage that “demography is destiny” is, to a large degree, wrong.As ever, our destiny is what we make of it."

    "published": "2025-08-01T06:45:33.730407+00:00",
    "content": "Two more men have come forward to accuse Christian rock superstar and Maga firebrand Michael Tait of drugging and sexually assaulting them – including Jason Jones, the founding manager of the American hard-rock band Evanescence.Jones said he was fired from the band – which had ties to Tait – for speaking out about his alleged assault. Jones said the firing, which he claimed happened in 1999, cut him out of Evanescence’s massive success beginning in 2003.“It destroyed me,” said Jones. “I was achieving my dreams at an early age, and Tait changed all that.”Evanescence co-founder Ben Moody denied Jones was fired from the band for speaking out against Tait.Moody said he does recall Jones telling him about a sexual encounter with Tait, but at the time Moody interpreted it as consensual.“I was a kid, only 18, and clearly didn’t realize what he was going through,” Moody said. “I’m sure I missed a lot of things I’d recognize today. I didn’t realize he was traumatized.”In all, eight alleged victims have now come forward publicly with sexual assault allegations against Tait. A previous investigation by the Guardian reported allegations of sexual assault by Tait against three young men while another from the Christian news outlet the Roys Report reported allegations by three other men.Tait became famous as the frontman for DC Talk and Newsboys, two Christian mega-bands known for packaging conservative rhetoric about sexual abstinence, sobriety, Christian nationalism and the coming rapture in catchy rock songs. Tait has been a supporter of Donald Trump and served as a key bridge between Trump and evangelical voters.Tait has not responded to questions from the Guardian about the allegations against him. But in an Instagram post in June, Tait confessed to a decades-long addiction to cocaine and alcohol and admitted that he had “at times, touched men in an unwanted, sensual way”.In the post, Tait added that he had recently “spent six weeks at a treatment center in Utah”.Jones was described by friends who knew him in the 1990s as a happy-go-lucky Christian teenager, bursting with ambition and creativity. Growing up in Arkansas, Jones remembers, one of his biggest dreams was “to meet DC Talk”.Jones achieved that dream in 1994 after moving to Nashville to manage the band of his friend, Randall Crawford, who was also friends with Tait and introduced the two.Jones recalled going to McDonalds with the DC Talk frontman and being mobbed by so many teenage fans they had to leave before getting their food. “That kind of thing happened a lot,” he said.Jones was thrilled to be welcomed into Tait’s inner circle, yet he was taken aback by what he described as Tait’s proclivity for randomly grabbing other men’s genitals. He said he eventually learned that Tait was living a double-life as a closeted gay man, which was becoming a problem for a band mentored by Moral Majority co-founder Jerry Falwell, who called Aids “God’s punishment for homosexuality”.While surprised, Jones held no negative feelings toward Tait’s sexuality, even taking him to gay clubs in Little Rock (at Tait’s request) when DC Talk performed there.Jones was regularly traveling back and forth from Nashville to Little Rock, and in 1995 he met aspiring musician Moody – the two of them hitting it off and collaborating on a project that would come to be named Evanescence.After co-producing the first Evanescence demo, Jones returned to Nashville and began talking up the band to his friend, Tait.Jones, as an evangelical, was sober and a virgin at the time. But he recalls getting caught up in a whirlwind of partying with Tait in 1995, chain-smoking cigarettes and marijuana and closing down bars, then returning to Tait’s house to continue drinking. Jones said he was uncomfortable with all of it, but was eager for Tait’s approval so he complied.“I had this band that I was trying to take places,” Jones recalled. “And [Tait] had the power to open doors for us in the industry. So I went along with whatever, but didn’t know what it would cost me.”Jones’ used his connection with Tait to help Evanescence get a foot in the door in Nashville, speaking with A&R people, record labels, venue owners, producers and musicians.Sources that wish to remain anonymous alleged that Tait had a rotation of attractive young men at his Nashville home at this time, some of them underage, and that Tait had a “no clothes allowed” rule in his hot tub. “He would put his penis against one of the jets, and tell us to do the same, saying ‘see, it feels good!’” recalled a source who visited Tait regularly at this time, and wishes to remain anonymous.“He was all about the shock factor,” recalled Crawford, who was close with Jones and Tait throughout the 90s. “He was always saying ‘let’s make out in front of these people!’ And I was like ‘no, you’re gonna destroy your career.’ But he felt untouchable. And in some ways, he was.”Around this same time, Crawford recalls Tait driving him through the campus of Liberty University – Falwell’s Christian college where DC Talk formed – speeding at 60mph and getting pulled over by campus security, who turned from anger to laughter when seeing Tait behind the wheel, even asking for pictures and autographs.“After they left, Michael turned to me, calm as ever, and said: ‘I can do anything and not get in trouble.’”Jones recalls drinking at Tait’s house one night in late 1998, just after DC Talk finished rehearsals for their Supernatural album tour. Jones remembers feeling tired suddenly, and Tait recommended he go to sleep in his bedroom. “I felt honored that he felt that close to me, that he trusted me enough to let me sleep in his bed,” Jones said.Some time later, Jones recalls waking up, his pants missing, and Tait was giving him oral sex. “I said no and pushed him off, but then, somehow, I passed out again. I woke back up and he was still doing it. I said no again, then nodded out. And then I woke up a third time, aggressively shouted ‘no!’ and pushed him harder. It was then that he left me alone.”Looking back, Jones said, “I believe that Michael Tait drugged me.”Two alleged victims from the Guardian’s previous report also say they believe they were drugged by Tait before their alleged assaults. In addition, a female accuser cited by the Roys Report said she believed that Tait supplied Rohypnol or some other sedative to a crew member on a Newsboys tour, who then drugged and raped her while Tait watched.Distraught and in need of comfort, Jones flew home to Little Rock the day after he said he was assaulted. There he confided in a friend and mentor – who wishes to remain anonymous – that he had had “a bad experience with Tait,” but wouldn’t go into details. “He wasn’t the same after that,” Jones’s friend recalled.Jones said that in early 1999 he had also confided in his friend and Evanescence co-founder, Ben Moody, about being sexually assaulted by Tait. “Ben was only 18 at the time, new to the music industry, and I wanted to warn him,” Jones recalled. “[Tait] was flying Ben out to Nashville to write songs together, to see if he fit in Tait’s inner-circle.”Moody remembers things differently.“He didn’t frame it as ‘sexual assault,’” Moody said. “He described it as like frat-boy joking around while they were drunk, with [Tait] saying ‘what’s the big deal? A dick’s just a muscle.’ And Jason said ‘the next thing I know he’s sucking my dick.’”Jones said he remains confident that he told Moody the full details of the assault, including that he verbally and physically resisted Tait three times as his consciousness came and went.Moody said he soon noticed a change in Jones’s demeanor. Jones, a passionate, fun-loving guy who was easy to get along with, began suffering manic swings from depression to rage to paranoia and then to dissociation. “After a late night studio he couldn’t get the car shifter into gear and he just started screaming, hurling his body around, jerking the shifter violently like he was going to break it off.”Moody said he and the band began wondering if they should continue working with Jones. In retrospect, Moody said: “I didn’t know what he was going through. Looking back I would’ve been a bit more attentive, but I was the typical 18 year old who wanted to be a rockstar.”Moody said that in a phone call with Tait, he mentioned that Jones had told him about a sexual encounter between them, which Tait then denied. “I wanted to get ahead of [Jason] talking shit about us and ruining the whole thing. Back then there were rumors Michael Tait [was gay] and at that point, right after [DC Talk’s Grammy-winning album] Jesus Freak, he was the biggest thing in Christian music history, and the scandal would’ve been a huge deal.”Jones and Moody differ on whether he was fired or quit, but both recall the incident with Tait – however it was characterized – as the turning point of the relationship.“I hid away after that,” Jones recalls. “I started snorting meth, then smoking it.”His isolation and drug binge would continue for five years.Moody said he regrets how things went down with Jones back then. “He was my best friend for so many years, and now I ask myself ‘how fucking blind could I have been?’”Evanescence went on to be one of the biggest bands in the world, winning “Best New Artist” and “Best Hard Rock Performance” at the Grammys in 2003 and eventually selling tens of millions of albums.The following year, Moody and Tait would go on to be roommates and musical collaborators, with Tait singing on Moody’s solo album, and Moody producing Tait’s solo album, Loveology. In 2003, Moody left Evanescence to pursue his solo career.Evanescence co-founder Amy Lee and other representatives of the band could not be reached for comment.Like Moody, Crawford remembers his friend Jones as a “a happy guy, a real sweetheart, but all that changed after 1998. I could tell something had happened. He didn’t tell me about it at the time, but he has since. And I believe him, because the same thing happened to me.”Crawford first met DC Talk when the band was filming the music video for its first single, Heavenbound, in 1989. Crawford was working in a movie theater in the same Nashville mall the band was filming in. He loved their debut cassette and when they came by to catch a movie he introduced himself and gave them a discount.Crawford remembers his friend Jason Jones getting squeezed out of the management position of Evanescence in early 1999, and that “it had something to do with Tait”, but was unaware of specifics at the time.Back then, Crawford was an ambitious musician, and was being hired to write songs for solo projects for Tait and DC Talk’s Toby Mac (the band went on “hiatus” in 2000, and never officially reunited). Mac’s project was later nominated for a Grammy and Dove Award. Crawford had also just signed his own record deal for his band, Webster County.Crawford recalls being distraught over a breakup one night in the fall 2000, and Tait inviting him over to hang out. “You’ll bounce back,” he recalls Tait saying, as he handed him a shot glass of Makers Mark whiskey.“I told him ‘just one,’ and took the shot,” he recalled. “I had a pretty high tolerance for alcohol at the time, but I blacked out shortly after I took that one drink.”Crawford said his memory picks up some time later, finding himself propped up on Tait’s kitchen counter, his pants around his ankles. “My legs were up in the air, and Tait was licking my anus,” he claimed. “I said ‘what are you doing, dude?’ and then he said the weirdest thing: ‘Hey man, did you catch the Colts game last week?’ Like we were just hanging out, chatting.”Crawford said that he fled Tait’s house, but has no memory of driving home. He said he is convinced that Tait drugged him.Two close friends of Crawford’s have corroborated his story. One of them confirmed that Crawford told him details of the alleged assault at the time, but only named the perpetrator two years ago. The other friend said he was told the whole story at the time.“I was never the same after that,” Crawford said. “The joy and drive I had for music went away. Suddenly I had stage fright for the first time, brain-fog, anger issues, depression, and was even suicidal for a time. It ruined my career.”Despite having finished recording the album for his band, Crawford felt unable to perform as a musician, and the record was never released.Both Jones and Crawford recall thinking their assaults were isolated incidents and continued to have some involvement with Tait. Jones accepted a phone call from him when Tait’s father passed away and he was distraught, and Crawford says he was “love bombed” by Tait and succumbed to future advances.After not speaking for years, Tait re-entered his life in 2020. Crawford’s wife was a musician herself, and Tait had offered to produce her album.“I had buried the memory of that night for a long time,” Crawford said. After seeing Tait again, Crawford said, a lot of feelings came to the surface and he found himself weeping uncontrollably in the shower. After confessing to his wife what had happened, she encouraged him to enroll in EMDR trauma therapy, which he said had been helpful.“Hearing Jason’s story recently broke my heart,” he said of reuniting with his friend, Jones, decades later. “I believe we’d both be in the music industry today if it weren’t for Michael Tait.”Jones has been sober since 2008. After leaving the music industry he worked in banking and co-directed a sober living facility. Today he travels around the country sharing his story of abuse and addiction (not mentioning Tait’s name when recounting the experience).Shortly after getting sober Jones contacted a law firm to ask about potential compensation he could be owed from Evanescence. According to his 2008 correspondence with the law firm that he shared with the Guardian, the firm told him that, because of the statute of limitations, his window for a suit against Evanescence had closed years earlier. Jones said the lawyers told him that, had he pursued the matter sooner, he could be entitled to up to tens of millions of dollars in compensation.Moody disputed the notion that Jones has ever had the right to compensation for his management efforts in the early days of Evanescence.Looking back 27 years later, Jones recalled the night he told Moody about what had happened to him. Warning him not only about Tait, but about the music industry in general, he recited a quote from the magazine journalist Hunter S Thompson, who said: “The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free.”“And that’s true for the Christian music industry as well,” Jones said. “Even more so, in my case.”"

    "content": "Something strange happened to Hayden Anhedönia in January. The 27-year-old artist known professionally as Ethel Cain was finishing off her upcoming album Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love You when she had to go to court. “I got into some traffic trouble,” she says coyly in her soft southern lilt. The plan was to drive from the courthouse in her home city of Tallahassee, Florida, to Toronto to wrap the album with her longtime collaborator Matthew Tomasi.“Listen,” she continues, leaning forward into her webcam – a glint behind the eyes, conspiratorial tone in the voice. “I don’t know what happened in that courthouse, but I walked out of there having been put on probation. I couldn’t go to Canada. I couldn’t go anywhere.” As a result, Tomasi flew down to Tallahassee. They holed up in Anhedönia’s tiny home studio and didn’t leave until it was done. When they weren’t working, they watched Twin Peaks for the first time.“Every day it was wake up, work, Twin Peaks, work, Twin Peaks, work …” They binged the whole thing in two weeks. Anhedönia even hunted down the synths that composer Angelo Badalamenti used on the soundtrack and sprinkled them on a few of her own tracks. One night they finished working, watched the final episode, and went to bed. She woke up to the news that David Lynch had passed away.“I was really happy that I finished the show while he was still alive,” she says. The synths “felt kind of like an homage. A way to keep David and Angelo and Laura [Palmer] alive in some small way.”Lynch’s work stages epic battles between darkness and light, pitting the purity of the individual against the corruption of the world; small-town life versus primordial forces of evil. The same battle plays out on Willoughby Tucker, which tells the story of what Anhedönia describes as “a deeply traumatised love story between two kids who are in love, but the world weighs on them”. It’s also present in her debut album, 2022’s Preacher’s Daughter, a southern gothic tale of a teenage girl named Ethel Cain who flees the confines of her religious upbringing only to be murdered and cannibalised by her boyfriend.The grisly subject matter made for unlikely breakthrough material, but Preacher’s Daughter ended up becoming one of 2022’s most critically lauded pop breakouts. In the space of a few months, Anhedönia jumped from collaborating with niche SoundCloud rappers to being featured in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and fronting campaigns for Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Miu Miu. When Preacher’s Daughter was rereleased on vinyl this April, it broke into the Top 10 in the UK, Australia, the Netherlands and the US, where Anhedönia made history as the first publicly trans musician to reach the Top 10 of the Billboard albums chart.Love was always my final frontier. I never progressed past the idea of love that I had as a teenagerAs far as ascents to fame go, Anhedönia’s was a baptism of fire. She has attracted the kind of invasive, obsessive fandom typically reserved for A-list pop stars. Owing to her sharp cultural commentary and eviscerating political takes – in a viral post after Trump’s election, she wrote “If you voted for Trump, I hope that peace never finds you” – her social media accounts are routinely trawled for “problematic” content, and her criticism of the US healthcare system has been discussed on Fox News. Speaking to the Guardian in July 2023, Anhedönia expressed a desire “to have a much smaller fanbase”.“I’ve long struggled with my identity in pop,” she reasons now. “I love pop music, but my issue for a while was the way fandoms operate.” Having seen the violence and trauma of Preacher’s Daughter spun into flippant memes, she had feared that any future release would be similarly received. “I’ve since made my peace with that. At the end of the day, you make what you make and you put it out and people can do what they want with it.”A recent firestorm over screenshots of things posted when she was 19, however, shows how merciless the spotlight can be. A slew of comments, including the use of racial slurs and rape jokes, were dug up from a “shameful” period during which she tried to be as “inflammatory and controversial as possible”, as she phrased it in a lengthy apology. “That was my account and those were my words”, she wrote, adding that she was now “truly sorry from the bottom of my heart”. But she hit back at further online speculation that she was “pedophile, a zoophile, or a porn-addicted incest fetishist”. She had been, she wrote, the target of a “transphobic/otherwise targeted smear campaign” that had also led to her personal accounts being hacked and family doxed and harrassed.Anhedönia holds several positions that can be hard to reconcile. She’s a trans woman who grew up in the conservative southern Baptist community in the Florida panhandle, and still has a deep love affair with the area. She looks like one of the ethereal sisters from The Virgin Suicides, and talks like a girl next door refilling your coffee at a roadside diner, peppering her musings on existentialism and Eraserhead with homely expressions of geez and whatnot. She has experienced sexual trauma and assault, while her music often leans – in her words – “into sadomasochism” and “the taboo”.Those nuances are often not acknowledged. “A lot of people don’t know how to interface with media that contains negativity or perversion or sexuality or immorality,” she says. “It’s not the first instinct to engage with these things critically – but when you see a bad character on screen, the movie shouldn’t hold your hand and say: Hey, that’s the bad guy. That’s your job.”In January, Anhedönia released Perverts – an experimental departure from Preacher’s Daughter, let alone standard pop fare. Billed as a standalone project, the hour-and-a-half sprawl of ambient, drone and slowcore compositions roots around themes of shame, guilt and pleasure. There are no hooks, no choruses and barely any lyrics. Rather, its unsettling blend of industrial murmurs and desolate spoken word reflects Anhedönia’s experience of wandering “the Great Dark” – her term for a brief but “scary” winter when she was struggling to adjust to life after coming off tour.Some listeners found it a challenging listen; others considered its references to madness and masturbation alienating. But it successfully reasserted the wide spectrum of Anhedönia’s music, which switches from soaring heartland pop-rock to sprawling abstract noise. “Now that the other end of the Ethel Cain spectrum has been established, I feel like I have a full range,” Anhedönia says.The second instalment of the Preacher’s trilogy, Willoughby Tucker serves as the prequel to Preacher’s Daughter, and has a similar structure – a pop-oriented first half full of youthful optimism, which plunges into slow burning instrumentals and thundering power ballads as the hammer of reality comes down. Beginning in the summer of 1986, it finds Ethel Cain as an insecure teenager “trying to navigate her first love in a broken world and a broken town”.It wasn’t the plan to go back in time. Anhedönia intended to move forward, on to more “mature” things, but something kept nagging at her. “That Ethel’s entire story began with the love that she had for this boy … It felt like it needed telling. And come hell or high water, it was going to get told. It was practically seeping out of me.” Finishing the album was “honestly really sad, especially knowing where Preacher’s Daughter goes. Sometimes it’s hard for me to listen to. I tell myself it’s all fictional, but sometimes I’ll catch a lyric and it’ll resonate exactly with how I’m feeling. And I remember that it’s coming from me.”Part of the difficulty in making Willoughby Tucker was the fact that Anhedönia had, at 27, recently entered into her first ever relationship. As she worked on this album, all her own 16-year-old anxieties came back. “Love was always my final frontier,” she says. “I never explored it. I never processed anything. I never progressed past the idea of love that I had as a teenager.” There were times when she was crying every day, begging for the album to be finished.She’s glad of the process now. “I see Ethel Cain as a piece of me that I separate from myself and discard, so that I can make good decisions in life,” she says. “If Preacher’s Daughter was my learning experience of what not to do with trauma and healing, Willoughby Tucker has been my experience of what not to do in love.”In the real world, bleak as it is, Anhedönia is determined to live well. Smiling between two long curtains of mousey brown hair, she reels off a list of reasons to get up in the morning: “A great breakfast, a beautiful sunrise, paying for someone’s groceries if they can’t.”And then there is love – in her view the most “high-risk, high-reward” feeling in the world. A few days before we speak, she “hard launched” her new relationship, sharing a video of her new boyfriend lifting her up on a truck parked on a dirt road, and kissing her.“Ethel Cain lived and died loving and praying to be loved back,” Anhedönia says. “The entire Preacher’s trilogy is centred around love. Love lost, love gained, love perverted, love stolen. Love is everything to us. It doesn’t matter what you love or who you love, but that you love something – and that love is what propels you forward every day. For better or worse, I think that is a beautiful thing.”Willoughby Tucker, I’ll Always Love You is released on 8 August."

    "content": "On Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage in June, Celeste appeared wearing smeared black eye makeup and a leather jacket moulded with the impression of feathers, latched at the throat. She evoked glamour and tragedy, a bird with its wings clipped. “My first album came out nearly five years ago and I didn’t expect it to take so long,” she said of its follow-up. “But I’m here now.”Celeste broke through in 2020, her voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday’s racked beauty, but sparkling with a distinctly British lilt: a controlled, powerful vibrato that stirs the soul. Despite her jazz-leaning balladry not being obvious chart fodder, she became the first British female act in five years to reach No 1 with her debut album, Not Your Muse, which was nominated for the Mercury prize. She also won the BBC’s Sound of 2020 poll and the Brit award for rising star and was nominated for an Oscar for best original song (for Hear My Voice from The Trial of the Chicago 7) the year after – but her chance to capitalise on those accolades was stalled by the pandemic. She had to halt her touring ambitions. Of the years since, she says: “Sometimes you worry: are you on your path?”Celeste was haunting and spectacular when I saw her at Glastonbury, but now, as we stroll through Hyde Park in central London, she is relaxed and laughs easily. She becomes distracted by a carousel ride – “They’re my favourite! I love the music” – then she is back to talking about the five-year struggle to make her excellent second album, Woman of Faces, which will be released in November.“The title was kind of a diagnosis of how I feel sometimes; a device to help me begin to understand my own complexity,” she says. She was born Celeste Waite in California to a mother from Dagenham, east London, and a Jamaican father. Her mother had found her way to Hollywood as a makeup artist and Celeste was born “quite quickly” after her parents met there. They separated when Celeste turned one and she and her mother moved to England to live in Celeste’s grandparents’ home. “It was almost like my mother was my sister, because we were both being looked after by my nan and grandad.”These are happy memories, but she has “these different weathers in my brain … I’ve always had this little tinge of melancholy.” Maybe, she says, it stems in part from a lack of rootedness: “You move from America to England and you don’t really remember it, but you know that there’s people that you’ve known there and built connections with. And then you don’t have that.” She wondered if she would end up with a mental health diagnosis, “something more clinical later on down the line. But I didn’t feel I really needed that.” Instead, she found solace in other artists’ music, “people’s lyrics and emotions and melodies, even how they dress themselves – that’s always been quite a big remedy without needing to have a professional”.While she is frequently compared to Adele and Amy Winehouse, unlike them Celeste did not attend the Brit school of performing arts, instead studying music technology at sixth-form college in Brighton and working in a pub as she got her career off the ground. “I’m really glad I taught myself to sing,” she says, arguing that it gives her “rawness and authenticity”. Her venture into music was galvanised by the death of her father from lung cancer when she was 16: “When you lose someone, every day you wake up and you’re stunned by the fact that they’re gone. And there’s a certain point where you say to yourself: I can’t do this any more, and that’s when you start to either go to the gym or get into a practice. For me, that was where I picked up music and became really focused.”People’s lyrics, emotions and melodies, even how they dress themselves – that’s always been quite a big remedyIn the mid-2010s, she started uploading music to YouTube and SoundCloud and got a manager. She was picked up as a guest vocalist for producers such as Avicii, while Lily Allen’s label released her debut single. “I worked double shifts in a pub on weekends to afford to go to the studio,” she says. “It took my energy away and I wasn’t able to sing as well any more.”But she carried on doggedly, got signed to the major label Polydor, bagged the 2020 John Lewis Christmas ad soundtrack and beguiled listeners on songs such as Strange, in which her vocal tone expresses every contradictory emotion in a breakup – resignation, hurt, bafflement, poignancy, even a kind of helpless amusement at how awful it all is – in just four minutes.She is clear that she has received plenty of support and encouragement within Polydor: “The people that signed me came into music with the intention to make meaningful, poignant, credible music.” But at the commercial end of the industry, there is still “a huge pressure to make money. If you’re not in the top 2% of acts who have such a huge fanbase, you maybe don’t get the freedom” to do adventurous work. She says that developing her initial sound caused friction. “I was hanging around all these jazz musicians like Steam Down and Nubya Garcia, real innovators, and it wasn’t easy for me to go into the label and be like: this is what I want to do.”She has managed to preserve a sense of strangeness and singularity. Unlike her earlier peppy soul-pop hit Stop This Flame, familiar to millions as backing music on Sky Sports, most of the songs on Woman of Faces don’t even feature percussion – almost unthinkable in 21st-century pop – and there aren’t many British singers on major labels doing symphonic jazz. She wanted “a cinematic feel” and referenced Bernard Herrmann – a composer for films by Hitchcock, Welles and Scorsese – in the studio as she worked with the conductor Robert Ames and the London Contemporary Orchestra. “Herrmann was a real innovator and it’s reflected in people like Busta Rhymes sampling him [on Gimme Some More] all those years later. So we wanted to make sure that if we went into that territory of a cinematic string orchestra, it didn’t feel like an impression of the 1950s – it sounded like something new.”With this ambitious scope and Celeste shuttling between sessions in Los Angeles and London, it took a lot longer than expected to complete Woman of Faces. It was originally due to be finished by the end of 2022 and released a year later. “I didn’t expect it to take so long,” she says. “And if I’m really honest with you, at the end of 2021, into 2022, I experienced some heartache and I fell into such a depression about it all.”A relationship had ended. “When you lose the person from your life that you really love, there’s a grief that comes over you,” she says. The album’s first single, On With the Show, was written at her lowest point. “I didn’t really want to go to the studio; I didn’t really feel like I actually wanted to live at that point. I didn’t find meaning and purpose in the music.” She just had the song title, which she shared with her collaborator Matt Maltese. “I didn’t even have to explain to him what it would be about, because he just knew. We spoke about the song and what it needed to be.”She had also recently seen Marius Petipa’s 1898 classical ballet Raymonda. “It’s about a woman in the Crimean war and she has two lovers: one is in Russia and one is in Crimea,” she says. “I could relate, because she was torn between these two entities: at that point, my dedication to music and my dedication to a person. And one was taking the energy from the other. So On With the Show was about me having to find the courage to let go of something, to meet back in with the path of my life as a singer.”Worse, she says, “social media had come in to erode my relationship”. As a public figure on social media, “people can view your relationship and have so much awareness of the fact that you’re even in one. There’s this really strange, invisible, intangible impression that interactions in that space can leave upon your living reality. I was upset at how much that had come to affect my personal, real life.” On Could Be Machine, a curveball industrial pop song inspired by Lady Gaga, Celeste explores the idea that “the more time we spend with this technology, the more we become it”.When you lose the person you really love, a grief comes over you. I didn’t find meaning and purpose in the music“My phone had become this antagonist in my life, via communication that I didn’t want to receive and the fact it could just be in your hand. It was quite alien, in a way. I hadn’t grown up with a phone stuck to my hand and it was something that I had to become more and more ‘one’ with in my music career.”She says that, during the relationship, love had reverted her to a kind of “child-like state … a really pure version of yourself, before the world has seeped in and shaped you”. Losing the person who brought her into that state meant that she had to “learn how to steer and guide” herself to rediscover it.She is leaning on other musicians to help her understand these difficult years. She cites Nina Simone’s song Stars, a ballad about the cruelty and melancholy of being a professional musician. “It says so much about the tragedy of where her life is at that moment in time, but then there’s so much triumph in the fact she even gets to express herself in that way.” Another inspiration for Woman of Faces was the 1951 musical romantic comedy An American in Paris and one of its stars, Oscar Levant, who spent time in mental health institutions. “I was really moved by what he seemed to carry in his being. And, I suppose, I relate a lot to artists who carry this pain, but their work eases it.”Whereas Celeste was previously in thrall to American blues and R&B (“the older sense of what R&B was in the 1940s”), down to the way she might “time things and phrase things and even pronounce things”, she has “learned what my true voice is and who I really am as a person. I still have some of that phrasing and pronunciation there, but I exist a lot more as myself, therefore I sing a lot more as myself.”Buoyed up by her and others’ art, does she feel happy? “Yes!” She grins and throws her hands in the air. “The main thing is finding happiness within the relationships I maintain around me and making sure those are kept really positive and nourishing.” She is glad to be in her 30s: “Age becomes kind of taboo for a woman in the music industry – but then you hear people like Solange speak about women really coming into their true sense of who they are within their work. There’s been a shift.”And if the happiness in her career ever dissipates, she has decided she will simply move on. “I don’t really see the need to live in a feeling of oppression, when I know there’s so much freedom outside this world. And anyway, I’m sure I would find my way back to it again. But on my own terms.” Woman of Faces is released on 14 November on Polydor In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

    "content": "Addison Rae – Headphones OnSummer is for out-of-office email bouncebacks, smashing your laptop shut at 4pm and putting it off until tomorrow. This year, no song represents the simple thrill of shrugging it off better than Addison Rae’s Headphones On. With a detached, lobotomy-chic delivery that’s drawn comparisons to Y2K-era Madonna, the TikTok star turned serious pop scholar breezes through a list of anxieties, from her parents’ relationship to the ever-present thrill of being bumped down a notch by “the new it girl”. Ultimately, our laconic heroine swaps a panic attack for slipping those headphones on and riding it all out with a song. Clocking in at exactly four minutes, there’s a straightforwardness to it all that I can’t help but appreciate. Rae will make you dance without working too hard. And that’s all I want right now. Alaina DemopoulosKatseye – GnarlyThis song, sung by a six-woman international K-pop group, begins with an analysis of how malleable English slang is. “They could describe everything with one single word, you know? / Boba tea, gnarly / Tesla, gnarly / Fried chicken, gnarly,” one member of Katseye sings, the bass thumping every time she says the most versatile descriptive word in the language, signifying intensity, both positive and negative. It’s the early 2010s, and we’re so back. The song is as maximalist as can be, similar to Skrillex’s 2011 Bangarang or Kesha’s 2010 hit TiK ToK. The music video, in which the group assembles a grotesque sandwich, calls back to 2010’s Telephone, when Lady Gaga does the same. The song is fun and rowdy. It speeds forward, apt for TikTok (the app), where it first gained popularity with a distinctive, jerky dance. If you like Gnarly, I would suggest going in search of other songs by one of the song’s writers, Alice Longyu Gao. Rich Bitch Juice and 100 Boyfriends feature the same mix of heavy bass and saccharine, electrified vocals and instrumentation. Blake MontgomeryJade – Plastic BoxSince squishing a NOW! compilation’s worth of ideas into three minutes on her solo single Angel of My Dreams, Jade has backed up what Little Mixologists always suspected – that she knows pop as if she has an MA in Bangers. Ahead of the release of her debut album That’s Showbiz, Baby!, there’s something invitingly scrappy to the way she’s dovetailed from brash EDM to orgasmic disco, discarding cheap wigs and Jade-branded buttplugs in her wake. (To my mind, the only other pop act exploring genre this boldly is Sabrina Carpenter, who is something like a spiritual sibling to Jade as well as her stylistic opposite.) Plastic Box bottles a certain Scandinavian strain of sweet melancholy, with Jade playing the jilted lover over seductive electro-pop. Co-producers Grades and Oscar Görres, the latter of whom helmed most of Troye Sivan’s slick Something to Give Each Other, hug her voice with rosy synths and a chorus that explodes in a cloud of confetti. It’s an end of summer party that’s chicer than SSENSE – and despite Jade’s antics that made her so much fun to follow, Plastic Box proves that she’s just as magnetic when she strips them away. Owen MyersPinkPantheress – IllegalTo me, summer feels like going at terminal velocity down a waterslide: an unstoppable blur that before you know it has spat you out in the run-out pool of autumn, dazed and blinking. PinkPantheress’s new 20-minute, 30-second mixtape Fancy That feels the same way, a rush of UK dance music history – heavy with samples of Basement Jaxx and Underworld and nods to Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada – guided by a flirt laying down the law in girlish RP. Illegal is the only time Pink’s grip loosens, thanks to a hero dose of THC that leaves her tangled in lust, paranoia and shame. Between the reality-obliterating synth strobes, her sensory production makes you feel all the freedom and frustration of being high, close breaths and screams flickering through the slipstream. Laura Snapesforty winks – commie bfThere are plenty of songs of the summer about falling in love or partying or breaking up or going for a long, gorgeous drive, but there are hardly enough songs for summer lethargy. When the mercury hits 90 degrees, all my friends go insane, my technology stops working, and I start napping for at least one hour a day. Enter commie bf, a blunt buzzsaw of a song on which forty winks singer Cilia Catello yells that “everyone and everything makes my ears ring” right before she and her bandmates unleash a maelstrom of nasty, dementedly catchy punk-pop. This is a funny, and fun, and ferocious track – loud and unruly, but so intensely catchy that even the guitar-music-averse among us would have to admire its moxie. Catello’s sheer frustration rings through every second of the song, enough to shake you from that heatwave-induced stupor and get your ass back into gear, no matter how sweaty and malcontent you may be. Shaad D’SouzaMK – Dior (featuring Chrystal)While pop fans fret about there not being a good enough song of the summer this year, the UK has gone ahead and anointed its choice anyway. MK’s Dior is now at No 1 in the UK charts, standard behaviour for a country whose inhabitants need only the faintest hint of a 4/4 pop-dance beat on a temperate day to crack open a tinned cocktail at 11am and go “wheeeeey” with arms stretched wide. US producer MK, AKA Marc Kinchen, has been around since the early 90s (he’s behind the still-ubiquitous Push the Feeling On) and therefore brings a level of craft to bear on his productions that puts them into a different league to all other mirrored-wall nightclub fodder. 2017’s 17 still shines like the white walls and high-tensile glass of an Ibizan villa; 2023’s Asking is as good as build-and-drop dance gets. 2025’s offering Dior is more coiled and sensual than those tracks, with a really dramatic delayed drop: silence and Chrystal’s a cappella vocal fill the space where you expect the beat, creating a simple but spine-tingling effect. The high fashion references meanwhile make it a sort of sequel to 2023’s equivalent dance-pop song of the summer, Cassö’s Prada. Ben Beaumont-ThomasHaim – RelationshipsBest efforts notwithstanding, the vibes aren’t great this summer. The news is terrible, the AI ominous, the culture still in an extended hangover from last year’s Espresso buzz and Brat bumps. There is no obvious song of the summer – the charts are basically tracks from 2024 or Morgan Wallen (though you wouldn’t know it in godless New York); Charli xcx basically headlined Glastonbury; people are too busy arguing over Sabrina Carpenter’s album cover to remember her Espresso follow-up Manchild. In this muggy malaise, I’ve been stuck on Haim’s Relationships – the LA trio’s best pop song to date, a bright, deceptively airy anthem for being fucking over it. Lyrically, this lead single off the sisters’ aspirationally titled fourth album I Quit describes the messy end of some ill-defined entanglement. But its spare, intoxicating production – simple piano chords, ambling bass, synths glimmering like barlights at 9pm dusk – evokes a more general, potent summer ennui. I normally want the bpm up when it’s hot, but this summer, I’ve been circling blocks to Danielle’s dreamy falsetto, ascending with her rhetorical questions – fucking relationships, don’t they end up all the same? – and then crashing back to earth with her “when there’s no one else to blame”. Feelings? In this strung-out summer? Try me next year. Adrian HortonThe Beths – No JoyThe most joyous sounding song of this summer addresses depression, numbness and the futility of it all. No Joy, by the tuneful New Zealand quartet the Beths, provides an ideal object lesson in the thrill of mixed messages in pop. The music couldn’t feel more summery or light, fired by bouncy powerpop chords and chirpy backup vocals. The video, set in a candy-colored child’s playroom, follows suit, with lead singer/writer Elizabeth Stokes deadpanning her way through lyrics like: “All my pleasures, guilty / Clean slate looking filthy” and “I feel nothing,” all while her bandmates smile with satirically exaggerated pleasure. It’s impossible to keep a straight face while watching or listening to it, despite the fact that the numbness Stokes reports in her words reflects something sadly real. The lyrics chronicle her experience on the dulling SSRI drug she has used to deal with her depression. True as that may be for her, the song winds up giving the opposite feeling to the listener. When she sings “no joy” over and over we feel nothing but – a twist that could make this the most ironic song of this summer, as well as the most irresistible. Jim Farbersombr – we never datedWelcome to sombr season. Summer ‘25 seems to have given us a new star, and he’s Shane Boose – otherwise known by his melancholy moniker, sombr. A native of New York’s bustling Lower East Side, at just 19 he has effectively launched his mainstream career with a series of chart-topping singles which flaunts the artist’s emotional, guitar-propelled lyrics. Yes you read that right, the new generation has officially rediscovered actual instruments, with the teenage artist seemingly channelling alt-rock acts like Arctic Monkeys and Radiohead, the latter of whom he’s cited as a major influence. Songs like We Never Dated flaunt brutally honest lyrics accented by guitar-picking led it to become an instant breakout upon its late June release, which makes it a no-brainer when it comes to Song of the Summer status. Meanwhile, he’s riding high on other explosive singles including Back to Friends, which recently was anointed as the most-streamed song on Spotify’s global charts. Rob LeDonneKhamari – Head in a JarWithout a factory-made earworm to invade our every waking moment, the floor has opened up to a wider selection of artists this summer and, as there always should be in my opinion, a wider selection of vibes to go with it. Songs of the summer are typically characterised by the infectious perk and sweaty overwhelm of mid-afternoon sun but there’s another seasonal feeling we all know, as the brightness starts to fade, that also deserves its space. Boston-born singer Khamari knows it too and in delicate downer Head in a Jar, he captures a brand of summery sadness that’s also rather seductive, a deliberate dive into dark feelings that’s as refreshing as an early evening breeze. It’s a song about being pushed away from the centre of someone’s life, forced to watch from a distance instead and, with a voice that has rightly earned comparisons to the mostly awol Frank Ocean, Khamari pierces right through. He’s quietly been gaining buzz since his similarly reflective 2020 EP Eldorado and this one deserves to vault him from the outside in. Benjamin LeeMatías Aguayo – El InternetYou know you’re in the right party if someone throws down this tune. The Chilean-German firebrand Matías Aguayo returned in May with a subversive dancefloor heater that has been building in notoriety over the subsequent months. It’s sung in Spanish but translates to, Aguayo says: “walking through the city on hot summer nights looking for the perfect dancefloor”. But it’s also a mission statement, longing for “revolutions in music and dreams in community” away from homogenisation, social media likes and solely facing the DJ booth. In the track, Aguayo remembers the freewheeling days of YouTube rips where you could hear “raw, primitive and direct music” from, say, a Syrian wedding or Angolan teenagers dancing on the streets – references for El Internet’s own jittery, restless rhythm and also his live DJ sets, where he sings and dances inside a circle in the audience, inviting onlookers to move freely with him and let loose. It’s lithe, gonzo techno for sticky evenings in search of catharsis and connection. Kate HutchinsonTom Rasmussen – Gay BarTaken from London-based polymath Tom Rasmussen’s High Wire, a remixed and reimagined version of last year’s excellent Live Wire album, new song Gay Bar – not a cover of Electric Six, apols – showcases two of my favourite summer past-times; trashy storytelling and gossip. Who doesn’t love a steamy page-turner on the beach, interrupted only by the details of last night’s escapades wafting over from the gaggle of pals nearby? On Gay Bar, Rasmussen details three attempts at a night out; the first is interrupted by a pint to the face, and then completely ruined by the gay bar now being a Slug & Lettuce. Night two, meanwhile, involves going to the place where “Danielle sucked on that MP’s armpit”, but – shock horror! - it’s now a Crossfit gym full of “muscled up yuppies”. By night three, with hope dwindling, Rasmussen takes a straight friend giving off “bi vibes” to a busy gay bar. As the song’s hi-NRG dance pop ratchets up, you find yourself gripped as the story reaches its climax; will Cassandra get off with anyone? What’s Rasmussen doing in the basement? When will the decimation of queer nightlife end? It’s a real page-turner. Michael Cragg"

    "content": "Cleo Laine, who has died aged 97, was not only the most creatively and materially successful jazz singer the UK scene has known, but was also respected worldwide as one of a handful of truly original jazz-inspired vocalists. From modest beginnings in the pubs and dancehalls of austerity Britain in the 1950s, the diminutive singer with the majestic and agile contralto voice went on to achieve international fame in a career that also embraced acting and writing.Laine could travel easily in almost any idiom, from jazzy standards-singing to the frontiers of classical music and opera, and she was the only female singer to receive Grammy nominations in the jazz, popular and classical categories. When she became the first British artist to win a Grammy as best female jazz vocalist (for the third of her live Carnegie Hall albums) in 1985, she received two dozen roses from Ella Fitzgerald and a card inscribed: “Congratulations, gal – it’s about time!”Even late in her career, Laine’s remarkable range, theatrical awareness of contrast and drama, sensitivity to melody and mood, and astute choice of high-class songs, prevented her from ever sounding remotely dated. Whether in coolly countermelodic duets with her husband John Dankworth, the alto saxophonist, in flat-out exercises in zigzagging scat or stomping swing, or in spacey moods of poignant reflectiveness, Laine was never less than the classiest of acts.In 1997, she and Dankworth were, fittingly, given a Royal Albert Hall Prom concert in honour of their joint 70th birthdays. As long-time stars of a usually low-profile British jazz scene, they brought together the worlds of dinner-jacket arts and unruly jazz. They helped put British jazz on the map, encouraged music education, smuggled jazz into the sensibilities of listeners who had thought they loathed it, and generally added a splash of style and confidence to a sometimes shadowy and defensive subculture.Laine’s onstage glamour would give way to a far more worldly and down-to-earth magnetism as soon as the spotlight was off. A candid and personable woman, she impressed those who met her with her easygoing alertness, unexpectedly small stature for those who had previously only encountered her on a concert stage, and penetrating green eyes framed by dark curls.She was also – in the age of the ubiquitous psychotherapist – mock-guilty about her lightness of spirit, saying simply: “I’m not a very neurotic person.” This realism allowed her to consider both her talents and her shortcomings with neither self-importance nor guilt. She would occasionally ponder whether two parents spending a lifetime on the road was not textbook childcare by some standards, but pointed out the independence and self-reliance of her children with Dankworth – their son, Alec, became a successful double-bassist and bandleader, and daughter, Jacqui, a vocalist, actor and songwriter with much of her mother’s canny timing, emotional subtlety, and inclusiveness of taste.Laine was born in Southall, west London, one of three children of a Jamaican father, Alexander Campbell, and an English mother, Minnie Bullock, who took in lodgers. Raised as Clementina Campbell (the fact that her birth had been registered under her mother’s name, before her parents married, did not emerge until she applied for a passport at 26, by which time she was performing as Cleo Laine), she showed early singing talent and was encouraged by her mother to take singing and dancing lessons.After leaving school at 14, she found work in a hairdresser’s, milliner’s, pawnshop, cobbler’s and library, and married for the first time, to George Langridge, in 1947, while still in her teens. But she was restless and the example of her father – who sang, and loved music, but made his living selling goods door-to-door – had also given her an inkling that a life in music might provide an escape.Modelling herself on the black singers she heard in American musicals such as Cabin in the Sky, she unintentionally developed a sound that was conspicuously different to that of most popular female singers of the 40s and early 50s. Choosing black artists seemed obvious to her, and the threatening implications of being in a racial minority in Britain were not as evident as they were to become later in the 50s. Laine recalled, however, that as a child during the second world war she had speculated on where children like herself might hide if nazism won.In her mid-20s Laine began seriously to apply herself to singing. She had started out in pubs (“useful training for improvisation” she would ruefully recall) and eventually auditioned for the successful British modern jazz band led by Dankworth. Though she was a raw unknown, Dankworth and his musicians recognised her promise.“I was amazed they liked me,” Laine told the Guardian in 1997. “I had begun to think auditions were my hobby, I’d been rejected on dozens of them, and talent competitions too.” But Dankworth was after somebody different, and Laine was unusual as a rich-toned contralto. She listened closely to Billie Holiday for her presence and sense of drama, Fitzgerald for the thought processes and technique that allowed her to improvise so exuberantly, and Sarah Vaughan for her operatic range. The mature Laine was to exhibit all these qualities.She toured the UK extensively with the Dankworth band in the mid-50s. She divorced Langridge in 1957 and the following year married Dankworth, and shared the care of her first son, Stuart – by then 13 and sometimes a traveller with her on the road – with her mother and sister. She accompanied Dankworth to the US in 1959 for his appearance at the Newport jazz festival, and sang with the band at Birdland in New York on the same trip. She also began to read widely, and developed an enthusiasm for poetry – particularly that of ee cummings, one of whose pieces she was to record as a song.She also started to act and was initially confined to Caribbean roles, but her skill bloomed, and she was to regard her appearances at the Edinburgh festival in the 60s and in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, 1967, as high points. But there were many others: Flesh to a Tiger, directed by Tony Richardson at the Royal Court theatre in 1958, the English musical Valmouth, the title role in Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, plus musical appearances in Show Boat, Colette, The Seven Deadly Sins, A Little Night Music and The Merry Widow.She also originated the role of Princess Puffer (and won several awards and nominations for it) in the Broadway hit musical The Mystery of Edwin Drood in 1985. She took on parts as diverse as the voice of God in the BBC Proms’ production of Benjamin Britten’s Noye’s Fludde (1990) and the Witch in Stephen Sondheim’s Los Angeles production of Into the Woods (1988).She recorded prolifically in the 60s, on show-song and soundtrack projects (Dankworth was an in-demand movie composer at the time) and straight jazz albums with guests including the British sax virtuoso Tubby Hayes and her vocalist contemporary Annie Ross, and in that decade she was also a frequent guest on the British TV satire That Was the Week That Was.Dankworth, meanwhile, had begun exploring jazz variations on non-jazz traditions in his own music, and broke through to a new public with arrangements of Shakespeare sonnets – Shakespeare and All That Jazz (1964), which won widespread acclaim and a five-star accolade in the US magazine DownBeat. Laine took to them eagerly – on slow pieces such as O Mistress Mine and Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day, she showed a remarkable ability to make the quietest sounds ring like tiny bells, and then be enveloped in a wash of resonant low notes.Classical audiences, too, were now beginning to wake up to Laine’s skilful control, rich tones and spontaneous jazz sensibility. She was Julie in the spectacularly successful 1971 London production of Jerome Kern’s Show Boat, made an acclaimed New York debut in 1972 and the first of her Carnegie Hall appearances (her Live at Carnegie Hall album from 1974 brought her a first Grammy nomination), and further expanded her palette in recording Arnold Schoenberg’s poetry-cycle Pierrot Lunaire, which was nominated for a classical Grammy. Despite an increasingly frenetic working life, she and Dankworth also oversaw the development of their Buckinghamshire home at Wavendon as a working theatre.Over the next decades, Laine collaborated with the flautist James Galway (1980) and classical guitarist John Williams (1984), contributed to Michael Tilson Thomas’s LSO series The Gershwin Years (1987), and a tribute to female songwriters including Joni Mitchell and Holiday (Woman to Woman, 1989). Her bluesily soulful encounter with Ray Charles (Porgy and Bess, 1976) was a highlight, as was a hip and swinging meeting with Mel Tormé (Nothing Without You, 1992). Laine also appeared alongside Frank Sinatra during a week of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 1992.Following her autobiography, Cleo (1994), Laine also published You Can Sing If You Want To (1997) – an informal guide to learning to use the voice freely and confidently as an instrument.The Dankworths slowed down only marginally in their 70s – their concerts worldwide still continued to sell out – and when Laine hit 80 in 2007 (Dankworth’s 80th having preceded hers by a month), she performed a series of UK shows, including a reunion of the John Dankworth Sextet that had set her stardom in motion. A four-disc box set, I Hear Music, was released documenting the pair’s work from 1944 to 2005.Dankworth’s health declined late in 2009, on a US tour that had to be curtailed. He died on the morning of 10 February 2010. He and Laine, plus a glitzy cast of guests, had been due to play at Wavendon that night, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Stables theatre. Impelled by the conviction that Dankworth would have wanted the celebration to go on, Laine went home from the hospital, played the gig, and broke the news of his death to a stunned audience only at the close.She continued to perform for some years, frequently with a Dankworth rhythm section including Alec on bass and the pianist John Horler, thus demonstrating, as at the Cheltenham jazz festival in 2011, that Laine could still deliver a classic jazz song such as Duke Ellington’s Creole Love Call with a freshness not far away from Adelaide Hall’s 1920s version of the original.Laine and Dankworth foresaw the contemporary developments that have led to the growing embrace of jazz innovation by audiences coming from the European art-music tradition, from western pop, or from cultures unrelated to either. Laine would readily agree that grand opera at its best was “glorious … but Louis Armstrong is glorious, too, and operatic in his own way”.For her musicianship, and for that breadth of view, she acquired a raft of accolades and prizes, and in 1997 she was made a dame. Her achievements were a rich blend of the creative journey and the crusade, qualities of a musical life that she and Dankworth conducted with the lightest of touches. Despite all the globetrotting, the jet-lag and the impossible schedules, it seemed more fun to them than working.Stuart died in 2019. Laine is survived by Alec and Jacqui.

    "content": "If a single individual could be said to embody the attributes of heavy metal, it would be Ozzy Osbourne, who has died aged 76 after suffering from Parkinson’s disease and other disorders. In a career stretching across six decades, Osbourne became a star with Black Sabbath in the 1970s, launched a hugely successful solo career in the 1980s, turned himself into a heavy metal entrepreneur in the 1990s with his travelling Ozzfest rock festival, and in 2002 became an unlikely but wildly successful reality TV star, thanks to the MTV show The Osbournes.The Black Sabbath repertoire included songs with titles such as Paranoid, Evil Woman, Hand of Doom and Children of the Grave. The atmosphere was darkened further by the guitarist Tony Iommi’s fondness for tuning his strings lower than usual, and lyrics (mostly written by the bass player Geezer Butler) that alluded to the occult and mental illness, sung in Osbourne’s urgent high-register whine. His voice was not pretty but it was impossible to ignore as it sliced through Sabbath’s dense sludge of drums, bass and fuzz-toned guitar. “Sabbath never set out to be legendary,” Osbourne said in 2005. “The only thing we set out to do was scare people.”Sabbath were a hit straight out of the blocks with their debut album, Black Sabbath (1970), which sailed into the UK Top 10 and reached 23 on the US Billboard chart, despite a hostile response from rock critics. Later that year they released the follow-up, Paranoid, which topped the British chart. Its tough and edgy title song gave them their only British Top 10 single (it went to No 4), while Iron Man and the outspokenly political War Pigs became staples of the Sabbath catalogue, each featuring a distinctive Iommi guitar riff.The band’s hot streak continued through the albums Master of Reality (1971), Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) and Sabotage (1975), but Never Say Die! (1978) signalled Osbourne’s departure and the end of Sabbath mark one. Following some chaotic touring and abortive recording sessions, Osbourne was fired in 1979. An alcohol-and-cocaine lifestyle coupled with legal squabbles with their management and record label had sapped the band’s strength. “I was drinking like a fish for two years,” Osbourne said. “I would have been dead in two or three years if I’d carried on.”Black Sabbath were managed by the notably unsentimental music mogul Don Arden, who assigned his daughter, Sharon, to keep Ozzy sufficiently acquainted with the straight and narrow to be able to write songs and perform. She became his manager and, in 1982, his wife. She launched him as a solo artist, leading his own band, The Blizzard of Ozz, which featured the gifted guitarist and songwriter Randy Rhoads. When Warner Bros and EMI turned Osbourne down as a solo artist, Sharon signed him to her father’s label, Jet. Osbourne’s solo career was immediately successful, his debut album, Blizzard of Ozz (1980), producing a couple of hit singles with Crazy Train and Mr Crowley, the latter inspired by the occultist Aleister Crowley.The follow-up, Diary of a Madman (1981), was another bestseller – in his autobiography, I Am Ozzy (2010), Osbourne cited this as his favourite album – and contained the drug-inspired hit single Flying High Again. However, Osbourne’s progress was rarely incident-free, and, marriage aside, 1982 was a particular annus horribilis. In January that year, when he was perfoming in Des Moines, Iowa, an audience member threw what Osbourne took to be a rubber bat onstage, whereupon he bit its head off only to discover that the creature was real flesh and blood. He was forced to seek precautionary treatment for rabies.The following month, he was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, after urinating on the Alamo cenotaph. As a police officer remarked, “Son, when you piss on the Alamo, you piss on the state of Texas.” Osbourne was banned from performing in the city until 1992, when he made a public apology and donated $10,000 to maintaining the monument. In March 1982, Rhoads was killed in Florida while joyriding in a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft, which crashed.The albums Bark at the Moon (1983), The Ultimate Sin (1986) and No Rest for the Wicked (1988) carried Osbourne through the 1980s on a surging tide of sales, but controversy was never far away. In 1986 he was sued by the parents of Daniel McCollom, who had killed himself while listening to Blizzard of Ozz; the parents contended that the song Suicide Solution was a “proximate cause” of his death. The case was dismissed in 1988, but Osbourne was then sued by the parents of another young man, Michael Waller, who alleged that their son too was driven to kill himself by hidden messages in the song. Again, the suit was dismissed.In 1989 Osbourne was arrested for attempted murder after trying to strangle Sharon while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. This caused him to spend six months in rehab. After he recorded the album No More Tears (1991), he announced that the tour to promote it (he called it No More Tours) would be his last before he retired. The album contained Osbourne’s only Top 40 solo hit single in the US, Mama, I’m Coming Home. The song was addressed to Sharon, from whom he was temporarily estranged.Recordings from the tour were released as Live & Loud (1993), which included many of his best-known songs, with the other members of Black Sabbath joining Osbourne for the track Black Sabbath. Live & Loud was intended to bring the curtain down on his career, and the track I Don’t Want To Change The World won him a Grammy for best metal performance in 1994.Ozzy was born John Osbourne in Aston, Birmingham. His father, Jack, did night shifts at the industrial company GEC, while his mother, Lillian (nee Unitt), worked for the motor components firm Lucas. He had three older sisters, Jean, Iris and Gillian, and two younger brothers, Paul and Tony. The family managed to squeeze into a two-bedroom home with an outside toilet in Lodge Road, Aston.He acquired the nickname “Ozzy” at primary school, after being initially dubbed “Oz-brain”, and while his school work was hampered by dyslexia, he showed interest in music and performing when he took roles in school productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas including The Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore and The Mikado. Soon, the influence of the Beatles loomed large. Ozzy claimed he had originally wanted to be a plumber, then decided he wanted to be a Beatle instead.He left school at 15 and took a variety of jobs, including trainee plumber, slaughterhouse assistant and apprentice toolmaker, and for a time worked at the same Lucas factory as his mother, where he tuned car-horns. An amateurish attempt at petty crime led to him being arrested while trying to steal a television, and he spent six weeks in Winson Green prison.After a stint as vocalist with an R&B band called the Approach, in 1967 Osbourne was recruited by Butler to sing with his band, Rare Breed. The group imploded almost immediately, whereupon Osbourne and Butler joined Iommi and the drummer Bill Ward to form Earth. In 1969 they changed their name to Black Sabbath, after a 1963 horror film featuring Boris Karloff. With help from the Birmingham club owner Jim Simpson, who acted as their manager, the band secured a deal with Vertigo Records, which released their debut album, recorded and mixed in two days.Osbourne’s early 1990s retirement lasted only until 1995, when he came roaring back with a new album, Ozzmosis. Though hardly a classic, this sold three million copies within 12 months, and, after his follow-up Retirement Sucks tour proved one of the biggest successes of the summer, Osbourne and Sharon created the heavy metal touring package that they dubbed Ozzfest. This became an annual event in the US, Europe and eventually Japan.Ozzfest presented a huge array of metal, thrash and hardcore bands, from Metallica and Judas Priest to Slipknot, Slayer, System of a Down and Linkin Park. In 2004 Ozzy and Sharon presented Battle for Ozzfest on MTV, in which bands competed to be included on the 2005 bill.In 1997 Ozzfest included a Black Sabbath reunion, after which the band recorded the live album Reunion (1998) and continued touring into 1999, appearing again at Ozzfest. A mooted new Black Sabbath studio album was put on hold while Osbourne completed a solo album, Down to Earth (2001).It was now that his career took its surprising lurch into TV. Following an appearance on MTV’s reality show Cribs, about celebrity homes, the Osbourne family were recruited for their own series, The Osbournes, which ran for three years from 2002. Featuring Ozzy and Sharon with their children Jack and Kelly – their elder daughter Aimee hated the idea and opted out – it resembled a surreal, outlandish sitcom liberally spattered with X-rated language, and became one of MTV’s greatest successes. He was back on TV in 2016 with Ozzy & Jack’s World Detour, which ran for three series, with Kelly joining her father and brother for the third in 2018.In 2003 Ozzy almost died after crashing his quad bike at his estate in Buckinghamshire. While he was in hospital he topped the UK singles charts for the first time with Changes, a Black Sabbath song he had re-recorded as a duet with Kelly.In 2005 he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as both solo artist and member of Black Sabbath, and the following year into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Black Sabbath. An album of cover versions, Under Cover (2005), was received unenthusiastically, but he was back to chartbusting ways with Black Rain (2007) and Scream (2010). The long-awaited Black Sabbath studio album, 13, finally appeared in 2013. Memoirs of a Madman (2014) was a compilation of the best of Osbourne’s solo work. In 2015 he received the Ivor Novello award for lifetime achievement at a ceremony in London.In 2016, Black Sabbath, including Ozzy, embarked on a year-long world tour, billed as the group’s swansong. However, it was overshadowed by further Osbourne family dramas. In May, news broke that Ozzy had moved out of the family home after 34 years of marriage. It emerged that he had been having a four-year relationship with Michelle Pugh, a hair stylist, and was being treated for sex addiction. Ozzy made a public apology, saying that he was undergoing “intense therapy”.In 2019, he was forced to postpone his No More Tours 2 concerts in Europe after being hospitalised with a respiratory infection. He was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, though this was not made public until 2020 (in 2005 he had been diagnosed with Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition which causes symptoms similar to Parkinson’s).In September 2019 he reached No 8 on the US singles charts with his performance on Post Malone’s Take What You Want, his first entry into the Top 10 since 1989. He released a well-received new solo album, Ordinary Man (2020), but cancelled planned north American shows to enable him to undergo treatment for Parkinson’s in Switzerland. In 2022 he released his 13th solo album, Patient Number 9.Earlier this month he gave his concert farewell at Villa Park, Birmingham as the finale of a day of metal music. A short set of solo songs was followed by another with his original Black Sabbath bandmates Iommi, Butler and Ward, ending with Paranoid.In 1971 he married Thelma Riley, and they had three children, Jessica, Louis and Elliot. Shortly after their divorce in 1982 he married Sharon. She survives him, along with the three children from each marriage.

    "content": "The announcement of Drake’s three-day headline set for Wireless’s 20th anniversary met with a mixed response. Having been eviscerated in a rap beef with Kendrick Lamar, he had seemingly lost all street credibility. Plus, three consecutive sets from one artist could be overkill. On the other hand, what better way could there be to mark the occasion? No artist is more emblematic of the interface between British and American music that is so central to Wireless (despite Drake being Canadian). And the triptych curation around his various artistic personae seemed like genius: the swoon-worthy Casanova, the menacing rapper, the Black diaspora-surfing chameleon (or “culture vulture”, if you’re a Drake-sceptic).Friday at the festival has an R&B focus, revealing rising star Kwn and the delightfully bluesy Leon Thomas. Summer Walker is somewhat garbled and listless. And then, after collaborator PartyNextDoor bores us to death for 20 minutes, Drake arrives, throwing it back with the 2011 heartbreak classic Marvin’s Room. The surprise army of R&B all-stars he brings on is incredible: Mario, Bobby Valentino, Giveon, Bryson Tiller; Lauryn Hill’s appearance is astonishing, despite the glaring audio issues that occur in the transition from Nice for What into Ex-Factor. It is a clear statement of Drake’s standing among the greats, an assembling of allies.Yet the set also feels disjointed and strained. After Tiller performs Exchange, Drake awkwardly asks if he’ll do another song, but Tiller walks off. He also won’t stop banging on about how much “love” he receives in his “true home”, London. It soon reads like desperation, a need to affirm that he is still adored despite becoming persona non grata. Then he floats above the crowd while blaring Whitney Houston’s recording of I Will Always Love You, telling everyone to embrace a stranger. He does this again on Saturday and Sunday. It is not new for his sets, but it still feels completely bizarre.The “mandem” Saturday is more thrilling. Lancey Foux brings an enviable swagger and deft lyrical flow, and grime collective BBK are a masterclass in rap performance – Frisco a clear standout with his GBTH Freestyle. When Drake comes on, he kills the vulnerable loverboy and brings aggression – getting the audience to bark like dangerous dogs. From last night’s emotional manipulation to “I don’t give a fuck if you love me” is quite the headspin, but an incredibly welcome one.The special guests are stacked: Fakemink, Dave, J Hus, Central Cee, Headie One, Skepta. But this is all a naked retaliation against the US rap scene, as he declares UK rappers superior to them (Skepta had days earlier declared war on the US with Friendly Fire). No one can think he truly believes this, and it only adds to the awkward atmosphere. When Vanessa Carlton turns up to vibe to A Thousand Miles just because Drake felt like it, all bets are off.The organisation on Sunday gets wayward as the app mysteriously changes to remove set lengths. Drake appears on the schedule twice, at 18:25 and 20:55, and a 21:30 curfew is looming. This doesn’t bode well, though the lineup is stellar. Vybz Kartel returns for his first London performance in 20 years. Despite some shakes, his rapid-fire toasting style is still serviceable, though hits such as Dancehall and Love Dem feel wasted on a crowd who don’t respond with much energy.Kartel’s performance runs past Drake’s scheduled first set, which disappears from the lineup, and the headliner lands on stage with only 45 minutes to perform. The closing “dance party” underwhelms as Drake aimlessly vibes out, seemingly choosing tracks on a whim. In the middle of his set, Rema comes on to perform five songs – which feels very odd given the time constraints.Without doubt this has been a history-making Wireless, but it feels as though it was laden with fan service – nostalgia and guest stars – to mask what was ultimately a bit of a heist. You’d feel less shortchanged on the final night had you attended all three days. But if you had a Sunday-only ticket, please stay on the line to your bank, your call is very important to them."

    "content": "As he would doubtless have admitted, the teenage John Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne did not seem much like someone with a glittering future ahead of them. His childhood had been troubled – he struggled at school, partly as a result of dyslexia, and suffered sexual abuse at the hands of two older bullies – and his prospects after leaving school aged 15 seemed non-existent. Even his attempts to become a criminal ended in farce. He was, he later noted, “fucking useless” as a burglar: a television he was attempting to steal fell on top of him; operating in the dark, he inadvertently stole a selection of baby clothes rather than the adult garments he had intended to sell around the pubs of his native Aston in Birmingham. Finally, he was caught and sent to prison for six weeks.“OZZY ZIG NEEDS A GIG” read the card he left in the window of a local music shop, and “need” seems to have been the operative word: by the time he joined a heavy blues rock band called Earth as vocalist, he was out of other options. It wasn’t even as if Earth, or Black Sabbath as they became, offered an obvious ticket to fame and fortune: their big idea to advance their career involved loading their van up with equipment, then driving it to other artists’ gigs uninvited, sitting outside on the off-chance that one of the bands performing pulled out and they could fill in.And when Osbourne opened his mouth to sing, you didn’t need to know about his dismal CV to realise life hadn’t dealt him a great hand. His voice was a desolate, unschooled wail, best suited to delivering songs that fitted the definition of rock’n’roll once offered by Dr Feelgood’s late frontman Lee Brilleaux: “Music about sod’s law and bad luck.”The creation myth of Black Sabbath – and therefore of heavy metal, the genre they more or less invented singlehanded – is that it was a brilliantly canny piece of branding on the part of drummer Bill Ward: if people queued up to see horror films, why not create a rock equivalent? Black Sabbath certainly arrived fully formed – every one of the musical elements that made them legendary is perfectly in place on the eponymous opening track of their eponymous 1970 debut album – but the music they came up with in response to Ward’s idea felt organic, not calculated. Black Sabbath sounded like a product of their environment: a grim, provincial, industrial world, where the drugs associated with the hippy counterculture had arrived, but not the freedoms or opportunities enjoyed by London’s bohemian elite. And they sounded like a product of their era. If one response to the end of the 60s party was to be found in the wistful, delicate morning-after melancholy of 1970’s biggest-selling album, Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water, then Black Sabbath provided another: music that seemed as if it was lumbering angrily around with the kind of monstrous hangover that feels more like a nervous breakdown, suffused with dark thoughts, alienation, self-hatred and paranoia.Their debut still carried hints of the heavy blues band they had been – side two in particular sounds like a kind of curdled Cream – but by the time of 1970’s Paranoid, they had honed their style into something entirely unique. It was hugely successful – quadruple platinum in the US – but, as with every early Black Sabbath album, critically reviled in a way that now seems scarcely believable: “The worst of the counterculture on a plastic platter … bullshit … dull and decadent … dim-witted, amoral exploitation,” opined American writer Robert Christgau of the band. Their reception set the tone for the way heavy metal as a genre would be dismissed by “serious” rock critics for decades to come, but there was a curious sense in which it worked in Sabbath’s favour, turning them into the people’s band, who connected with a vast audience of disaffected teenagers (“the kid down the block … slumped in his bedroom gorged on Tuinal … finding justification for his cancerous apathy,” as one contemporary writer characterised their fans) without the aid of the media.Osbourne bolstered that image himself. For all the dark mythology that surrounded the band – they seem to have spent a significant portion of the early 70s explaining to journalists that they weren’t actually satanists – he cut a curiously unstudied figure on stage. Watch the YouTube footage of the band performing at the California Jam festival in April 1974 and what’s striking is the disparity between the way they sound – monstrously heavy and dark – and the way Osbourne looks. No moody scowling or sullen posturing: he strips his shirt off, jumps up and down excitedly, claps along, raises his hands to the sky and waves his arms in delight. He behaves remarkably like a member of the audience who’s been allowed on stage and can’t quite believe his luck: in an era of rarefied rock gods preening, here was a rock star whose every move suggested he was just like you.The California Jam footage arguably captures Black Sabbath at their peak. The following year, Sabotage brought to an end a run of virtually flawless albums: Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne considered leaving the band during the recording of 1976’s Technical Ecstasy, a confused attempt to expand their sound in the face of a changing musical climate – he toyed with starting a new band called Blizzard of Ozz – but instead found himself fired after the release of its underwhelming follow-up Never Say Die! His bandmates blamed drink and drug-related unreliability, Osbourne insisted that he was no more indulgent than the others. Whatever the truth, even Osbourne himself seemed to regard his sacking as the end of his musical career: he holed up in an LA hotel room, apparently intent on spending his severance pay on alcohol and drugs in the belief that “after this I’m going back to Birmingham and the dole”.He reckoned without the intervention of the formidable Sharon Levy, sent to LA by her father, Black Sabbath’s manager Don, to keep an eye on the singer. The pair not only became romantically involved, marrying in 1982, they proceeded to pull off a dramatic reinvention of Osbourne’s career, hinging on a happy accident and an inspired idea.The happy accident was Osbourne stumbling across a virtually unknown guitarist called Randy Rhoads. In Rhoads’ retelling of the story, Osbourne was so drunk at his audition that he hired him after only hearing him tune up. The inspired idea was to embrace the kind of negative attention that Black Sabbath had always attempted to dismiss. By the early 80s, heavy metal was a hugely successful musical genre. As its stock rose, so did the attention paid to the kind of lyrical themes that Black Sabbath had once specialised in. In the US in particular, rightwing conservatives and Christian fundamentalists created a mini-industry in taking self-evidently preposterous metal lyrics at face value and detecting inferences that were clearly completely unintentional. If heavy metal was now deemed an authentic threat to public morality rather than escapist entertainment, was Osbourne and Arden’s thinking, then the genre’s co-creator should be an embodiment of outrage.Out went the excitable frontman who was just like you. In came Ozzy Osbourne, cartoonish Prince of Darkness, who bit the head off a dove during a record company sales convention, then repeated the trick on stage in Des Moines, Iowa, this time with a live bat; took all his clothes off and dipped his testicles in a glass of wine at a dinner with his German label bosses; and urinated on the Alamo Cenotaph.It wasn’t entirely clear whether Osbourne himself was working to some brilliant self-publicising masterplan or just a raging alcoholic doing ridiculous things because he was pissed, but either way, the attendant controversy sent his popularity skyward, helped by the fact that his first two solo albums, 1980’s Blizzard of Ozz and 1981’s Diary of a Madman, were infinitely better records than anyone who had encountered Osbourne towards the end of his tenure with Sabbath would have believed he was capable of making. His voice was apparently unaffected by the abuse he visited upon his body. Rhoads was a lavishly gifted guitarist, his classical training – most obvious on Diary of a Madman’s title track – shifting his playing away from the blues-based style that had dominated hard rock in the 70s, presaging the way heavy metal would move in the 80s. The songs they came up with were more varied than the cartoon imagery would suggest: the most obvious influence on Goodbye to Romance was Osbourne’s beloved Beatles in their psychedelic prime.The albums and the outrage made Osbourne so famous as a solo star, he seemed weirdly impregnable. Nothing, it appeared, could dent his success. Not the death of Rhoads in a 1982 plane crash, nor the noticeable decline in quality of Osbourne’s albums – 1982’s pointless collection of re-recorded Black Sabbath songs Speak of the Devil, the full-bore glam metal of 1983’s Bark at the Moon – nor his increasing addiction problems. He sounded rejuvenated by the arrival of guitarist Zakk Wylde on 1988’s No Rest for the Wicked and 1991’s No More Tears, but in between was arrested for attempted murder after strangling his wife, Sharon, during a drink and drug binge.He subsequently emerged from rehab – his marriage, incredibly, still intact – but remained an uneven recording artist for the rest of his life. Genuinely great albums – including 2001’s underrated Down to Earth, reunited with Wylde and with a pre-Metallica Robert Trujillo on bass – shared space in his discography with wan efforts such as 1995’s hopelessly overproduced Ozzmosis, and stuff that lurked somewhere inbetween, a category in which you might reasonably place Black Sabbath’s Rick Rubin-produced reunion album 13. You could never have accused Osbourne of shying away from the unexpected, whether it was experimenting with Auto-Tune on 2022’s Patient Number 9, or offering up a remarkably faithful version of John Lennon’s distinctly soppy Woman on 2005’s Under Cover. Again, the mixed quality of his output did nothing to affect his standing. His celebrity was boosted by reality show The Osbournes, which elevated him to national treasure status, something it was hard to imagine happening in the years when his audience was held to be Tuinal-gorged losers scarred by the cancer of apathy. And perhaps more importantly, under Sharon Osbourne’s aegis, he fully embraced his Godfather of Metal tag, presiding over the scores of younger artists who appeared at his annual Ozzfest tours – and, finally, his poignant farewell with the all-star Back to the Beginning concert, just three weeks ago. The sheer number of artists who turned out to pay homage in Villa Park was astonishing: it said everything about the regard in which the band and its frontman were held by the metal community.However much heavy metal has changed and developed over the last 56 years, it’s very difficult to imagine how it might have turned out had Black Sabbath not existed. Every artist who chose to work in the genre thereafter – and indeed umpteen artists that didn’t – carries something of Black Sabbath in their DNA, and one suspects they always will. It’s equally hard to imagine Black Sabbath making anything like the impact they did without Ozzy Osbourne. “I always thought that whatever I had was temporary,” he wrote in his autobiography I Am Ozzy, a line that perhaps harks back to his desperate pre-Sabbath early years. The exact opposite proved to be true."

    "content": "It’s hard to overstate the impact of Ray of Light, Madonna’s seventh album. Released in 1998, it totally reshaped Madonna’s career, embracing trip-hop, electronica and Britpop and essentially proving to an unfriendly public that she was one of pop’s great auteurs. It spawned one of her biggest singles – the haunting power ballad Frozen – and its title track is still a staple of radio and DJ playlists. In the past few years, many of contemporary and underground pop’s most significant names – including Caroline Polachek, Addison Rae, a.s.o., Shygirl and FKA twigs – have referenced Ray of Light, whether directly or indirectly. It’s a fool’s errand to try to make a case for the best or most significant Madonna album – she has at least five strong contenders – but if there’s a consensus pick, it’s Ray of Light.Which is why the announcement of Veronica Electronica, a full-length Ray of Light remix album, was met with such hysteria from fans earlier this year. Madonna has spoken at length over the years about both Veronica the character – in true Madonna fashion, Veronica stems from a vaguely contradictory concept in which she is both a girl dancing at a club and, somehow, “medieval” – and the album, which she intended to release after Ray of Light but ended up shelving. For diehards, the promised record is something of a holy grail – never mind that this long-awaited release only contains two truly new songs, one of which, an old demo titled Gone Gone Gone, has been floating around on the internet for years.Even so, it’s hard to deny the simple pleasures that can be derived from hearing some all-time great Madonna remixes cut down to radio length and sequenced like the original Ray of Light. Drowned World/Substitute for Love sounds great taken out of its original glacial trip-hop context and turned into a DayGlo acid rager by BT and Sasha; the emotional ambiguities of the original song are replaced with warm positivity, and you can easily imagine the song soundtracking the final minutes of a raging house party as the sun begins to rise. Other tracks, such as Peter and Victor’s remix of Skin – the other new song here – take an opposite tack; they heighten Skin’s innate moodiness with a steely, exploratory techno beat punctuated by big, sharp breaks, turning the original track into something tweaky and unsettled.As is often the case with remix records, there are moments on Veronica Electronica that feel perfunctory – namely, the Club 69 remix of Nothing Really Matters. Perhaps any remix of the original song will always be held to a higher standard, given its status as one of the only out-and-out club tracks on Ray of Light, but unlike many of the remixes on the album, it feels as if there’s no relationship between the source material and the rework here, aside from Madonna’s vocal, which is looped to the point of irritation. It’s frustrating when people claim to “hate remixes”, as if you can put a blanket statement on an entire artform, but this kind of remix may make you sympathise with the sentiment.Fabien’s Good God mix of The Power of Good-Bye, on the other hand, represents all the potential of a curio project like this: a bizarrely minimal drum’n’bass rework of one of Madonna’s best ballads, it finds enormous power in the conflict between Fabien’s increasingly frenetic drums and Madonna’s serene, sorrowful vocal. It’s a surprisingly appropriate lead-in to Gone Gone Gone, a song so brilliantly weird that you really can understand why it was left off the original album. It is, essentially, a wistful breakup ballad set to a squelchy electro beat – a surreal tonal clash that hardly gels with Ray of Light’s placid waters, but which gives a surprising amount of insight into Madonna’s creative state at the time: here is one of the biggest stars in the world, in her creative prime, throwing anything at the wall to see what sticks. For that peek behind the curtain alone, Veronica Electronica is worth the price of admission."

    "published": "2025-08-01T06:45:43.612618+00:00",
    "content": "Tyler, the Creator’s ninth album received a very contemporary grand unveiling. Rush-released two days after its existence was announced, it had been trailed by the appearance of cryptic art installations at the rapper’s live shows – he’s still theoretically touring his last album, 2024’s Chromakopia – and at One World Trade Center in New York, and by a flurry of online gossip: one US website was forced to retract and apologise for publishing a tracklisting, complete with guest appearance by Kendrick Lamar, that turned out to be fake.Despite all this, Tyler Okonma seemed keen to deflate the kind of anticipation that arises when your last three albums have all been critically lauded, platinum-selling chart-toppers full of big ideas. “Y’all better get them expectations and hopes down,” he posted on X, “this ain’t no concept nothing.” He then published an essay that read suspiciously like an explanation of the album’s concept, bemoaning the intrusion of cameraphones and social media on our ability to live in the moment: “Our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme.”So what is Don’t Tap the Glass? A proper follow-up to Chromakopia or an interstitial release? A random selection of songs with no overarching theme, or something made with more deliberate intent? The answer seems to be: all these things. It lasts less than half an hour, and is noticeably, if not entirely, lacking the soul-searching that helped define its predecessor. The lyrics tend to stick to braggadocio and reaffirmations of the nihilistic persona Tyler inhabited in the days when he was deemed such a threat to the country’s morals that anti-terrorism legistation was invoked to ban him from the UK: the first, but far from last, mention of him not giving a fuck about anything arrives less than 30 seconds into the album. There are a lot of memorable one-liners, among which “I don’t trust white people with dreadlocks” and his dismissal of an ageing rival stand out: “49, still in the street / Your prostate exam in a week.”It also eschews Chromakopia’s kaleidoscopic musical approach, its sudden leaps from Beach Boys harmony to Zamrock samples to guest spots from Lola Young and Lil Wayne. It’s still eclectic in its choice of source material – opener Big Poe samples Busta Rhymes and a 2015 collaborative album made by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Shye Ben Tzur and India’s Rajasthan Express – but ultimately feels more narrow and focused. Almost all of its 10 tracks seem fixated on the dancefloor. There are 808 beats, Kraftwerk-y electronics, a noticeable smattering of Zapp-like vocoder and electro, among other early 80s genres. Powered by a bassline that’s a dead ringer for that of Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall and decorated with washes of synthetic strings and a falsetto vocal, Ring Ring Ring feels like a lost Leroy Burgess boogie production from the same era. The huge, distorted breakbeat of Big Poe recalls the rhythms produced by the Bomb Squad in their prime, amplified by the stentorian, Chuck D-like tone of Pharrell Williams’s guest rap. Elsewhere, I’ll Take Care of You unexpectedly transforms from a beatless electronic ballad into something that – with its clattering rhythm and grimy sub-bass – most closely resembles old skool UK hardcore rave: in a neat bit of self-referentiality, the clattering rhythm is actually repurposed from the title track of Tyler’s 2015 album Cherry Bomb.All of this is done fantastically well. The musical reference points are deployed with an evident love and understanding of the source material, never feeling like box-ticking or pastiche; the hooks work with enviable efficiency. It’s all funky enough that you imagine even the selfie-obsessed pocketing their phone and throwing themselves around if it came booming from some big speakers.But it’s also not the whole story. There are scattered moments when Don’t Tap the Glass feels of a piece with, or an addendum to, Chromakopia. In the middle of the album lurks the incongruous Mommanem, thick with the grunts and gasps and feral barks that were Chromakopia’s sonic signature. On the concluding Tell Me What It Is, Tyler suddenly drops the boasts and the IDGAF stuff in favour of precisely the heartsore self-examination that characterised his previous album, the sentiments amplified by the untutored frailty of his singing voice: “I’m feeling like a bum … is there a traffic to my soul? I need answers … Why can’t I find love?”It’s an odd way to end an album that seems largely about not overthinking things and simply giving yourself up to the moment, but, then, this is the man who once rapped “I’m a fucking walking paradox / No I’m not.” Fourteen years on, Tyler, the Creator clearly still reserves the right to be contradictory. When the results are as good as Don’t Tap the Glass, who can blame him?This week Alexis listened toBlood Orange – The Field Not a song of the summer in the accepted dancefloor banger sense, but The Field’s Durutti Column sample, skittering beats and ethereal vocals (by Caroline Polachek and Daniel Caesar) are the perfect soundtrack to a languid afternoon."

    "published": "2025-08-01T06:45:44.570522+00:00",
    "content": "Two weeks ago, halfway through his first ever UK show, Hanumankind instructed the crowd to mimic him by hopping to the right then to the left, back and forth, in unison. But the rapper from India slipped and fell, limping to the end of the gig in evident pain, kept upright by his DJ and inspired by the audience’s singalong familiarity with his catalogue.“We were ready to have a good time,” he sheepishly grins from an armchair at his record label’s offices three days later. It turns out he has torn a ligament. “It was a battle of internal turmoil. The show was like a fifth of what it was meant to be, but I gave it my all. London has a beautiful energy which gave me strength.”Even without the leg injury, the 32-year-old star, who was born Sooraj Cherukat, has reached a testing threshold in his short, explosive career. His tracks Big Dawgs and Run It Up, helped by action-movie music videos, have made him one of the most talked-about MCs in the world. A$AP Rocky and Fred Again are among his recent collaborators. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi even invited Cherukat to perform at an event in New York last September.But as a rare south Asian face in globally popular rap, he feels a certain responsibility. “The past year has been hard,” he says. “I’m trying to navigate through it.” What’s more, although he expresses a deep pride about life in India, “a lot of things are off. There is a mob mentality. There’s a lot of divisiveness because of religion, background, caste. It doesn’t sit well with me. I’m in a unique space to change the way people can think within my country.”I’m not just trying to speak to people who already agree with meBorn in Malappuram, Kerala, which he remembers as a “green, beautiful environment”, Cherukat spent his childhood following his father’s work abroad, from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia to Britain. “We’d traverse different countries and I’d sing songs in whatever language I was picking up,” he says. “Wherever I went, I had to get involved and be ready to leave. I learned to connect with people. That’s why the power of the word is so important to me.”At the age of 10, he landed in Houston, Texas, and found a rare stability. It was the early 2000s and the city was an engine room for rap innovation. Cherukat set his accent to a southern drawl. Already a fan of heavy metal – which makes sense given his grungy, rockstar leanings today – he became hooked on the local chopped-and-screwed subgenre pioneered by DJ Screw, Three 6 Mafia and Project Pat. In his teens he was “burning CDs full of beats, riding around smoking blunts and hitting hard freestyles”.He returned to south India just before hitting 20. “The only place I had roots,” he says. He completed a university degree in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, before working a corporate job in the tech hub of Bengaluru. Seeing rap as “a party thing, a way to de-stress and stay connected to the art form”, he performed at open-mic nights, softening his US accent and perfecting his stage show for an Indian audience. “Friends would come to watch and be like, ‘Dude, you’re not bad. You should lock in.’”So he did. At the end of 2019, Cherukat played his first festival: NH7 Weekender in Pune, Maharashtra. The crowd went wild, quickly morphing from a small handful into a packed moshpit. “They’re rowdy and they’re fucking vibing,” he says. “I rip my shirt off. I’m like, ‘OK, I can do this!’” He quit his job and began plotting his next move, filling notebooks with lyrics throughout the pandemic. These are a blend of cheek and grit delivered with a flow that keeps respawning at different speeds and scales. Soon, Cherukat was signed by Def Jam India.Part of a movement to reject the remnants of British colonialism in favour of local expression, the proud, rebellious patchwork of Indian hip-hop encompasses the vast country’s “hundreds of languages, each as deeply rooted as the next”, Cherukat explains. “Someone who speaks Hindi or another regional language will give you a vast amount of depth and detail in what they’re doing.” His decision to rap mostly in English therefore came with risks of being perceived as inauthentic at home, but it has certainly helped his global crossover.Besides, he has found other ways to communicate a homegrown aesthetic. Run It Up marches to the beat of Keralan chenda drums, while its video features martial artists from disparate corners of India. Cherukat performed it with a band of drummers at Coachella festival, his debut US gig. “Most people don’t know what is going on in my country,” he says. “Maybe I can open up some doors, open up some eyes, break out of these bubbles and stereotypes.” Although not religious, Cherukat has a divine figure woven into his performing name. Over recent years, Hanuman, the simian-headed Hindu god of strength and devotion, has been employed everywhere from the car stickers of hypermasculine Indian nationalism to the bloody, satirical critique of Dev Patel’s 2024 thriller, Monkey Man. Where does Hanumankind fit into this: traditionalist or progressive? “I need to make music for myself first,” he says simply. “But when you have a platform, you can bring about change through your words and actions.”Some fans were disappointed that he accepted the New York invitation from Modi – whose Hindu nationalist government has been accused of democratic backsliding and Islamophobia. Cherukat has defended his appearance, describing it as “nothing political … We were called to represent the nation and we did that.”But today he claims his “political ideology is pretty clear” to anyone who has been following his career. In one of his earliest singles, 2020’s Catharsis, he rails against systemic corruption, police brutality and armed suppression of protest. “I’m not just trying to speak to people who already agree with me,” he says. “I’m trying to give people who are otherwise not going to be listening a chance to be like, ‘OK, there is some logic to what he’s saying.’”Monsoon Season, his new mixtape, is just out. It features the mellow likes of Holiday – performed on the massively popular YouTube series Colors – as well as raucous collaborations with US rap luminaries Denzel Curry and Maxo Kream. It is less a narrative album, more a compilation, with songs gathered over the years before the spotlight shone on him.“I have a lot of memories of coming into Kerala during the monsoon,” says Cherukat of the project’s name. “You can have days where things are absolutely reckless, flooded, out of control. There can be days where you get introspective and think about life. There are days where you love the rain: it feels good, there’s that smell in the air when it hits the mud, the soil, the flowers. Your senses are heightened. You can fall in love with that. Or it can ruin all your plans and you hate it.”Cherukat’s knee will take some time to recover before he embarks on a North American tour later this year. It’s clear he needs a break: not just to heal, but to continue processing fame, adapt to its changes and return to the studio. “I’m still adjusting,” he says. “The attention, the conversation, the responsibility, the lifestyle, all this shit. Things have been a little haywire. So I just want to go back to the source – and make music.” Monsoon Season is out now on Capitol Records/Def Jam India"

    "content": "Elton John and Spin̈al Tap have joined forces on a new version of the band’s song Stonehenge – and have finally corrected one of the great scenery-based mishaps in classic rock.The song, performed in the 1984 rock-mockumentary This Is Spin̈al Tap, is at the heart of one of the film’s most cherished scenes: when the band, having made a mistake when commissioning an 18ft Stonehenge stage prop, have to make do with an 18in version being lowered from the rafters. After some hired dwarves caper around it, the band’s David St Hubbins complains that they looked likely to crush it underfoot.No such problems with the new version made for the long-awaited sequel Spın̈al Tap II: The End Continues, which will be released 12 September in the US and UK (and 25 September in Australia). In the scene, released today along with a recording of the song on streaming services, the band put in a considerably more triumphant performance, complete with full-sized standing stones and the return of the dwarves.Appearing in a cloak from beneath the stage is Elton John, who takes over the lead vocal, singing lyrics such as “Stonehenge, where a man’s a man / and the children dance to the pipes of Pan” with the requisite po-faced grandeur.John is one of a number of starry cameos in the film, along with Paul McCartney, Questlove, Metallica’s Lars Ulrich and more. Michael McKean reprises his role as St Hubbins alongside Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel and Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls, heading up a supporting cast filled with British comedy stars such as Nina Conti, Chris Addison and Kerry Godliman.The film will have the documentary film-maker Marty DiBergi (played by Rob Reiner) following the group as they prepare for a final reunion show. The first trailer was released earlier this week.An accompanying soundtrack album has also been announced. Elton John will appear again on Flower People, while McCartney joins them for Cups and Cakes, and country music couple Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood perform Big Bottom."

    "content": "From ManchesterRecommended if you like Pavement, Ezra Furman, Guided By Voices Up next Debut EP out 8 AugustWestside Cowboy describe their sound as Britainicana. You get what they mean. The winners of this year’s Glastonbury Emerging Talent competition are the product of a burgeoning new Manchester underground scene but started out performing Hank Williams and Bob Dylan covers in drummer Paddy Murphy’s bedroom. While the vocals locate them firmly in the UK, there’s a distinct country/rockabilly undertow to their sound.But equally, Britainicana feels like a slightly ungainly term for music that seems so natural and spontaneous. Recent single Alright Alright Alright rattles along at high speed, its influences buried under a layer of fuzz and feedback and punky vigour, the guitar lurching from the central riff into bursts of noisy abstraction: it sounds like a snatched recording of a band playing live, complete with the thrilling sense that their performance is seconds away from collapsing.The quartet’s debut EP is forthcoming, and the first tastes of This Better Be Something Great are more sedate. I’ve Never Met Anyone I Thought I Could Really Love (Until I Met You) lopes in time-honoured slacker style; Shells starts out as a hushed ballad before unexpectedly bursting into life 90 seconds in. But they’re equally marked by a mood of ramshackle invention at odds with the studied, polished air of a lot of current alt-rock. The name, incidentally, comes from the horse riders employed to ensure trains didn’t exceed a certain speed in 19th century America: another weird choice, given the velocity Westside Cowboy currently seem to be travelling at.

    "content": "As the booming sub-bass of LFO rattled around an old Sony warehouse on the outskirts of Leeds in July 1990, the reverberating sound was enough to mute the buzz of police helicopters circling above. However, when their lights began to pierce through the glass windows, the 800-plus ravers at Love Decade knew something wasn’t right. “There was a dark, intense atmosphere,” recalls Jane Winterbottom. “I felt trapped, claustrophobic, and a wave of nausea came over me. I wanted to escape but I couldn’t. All the doors were shut and we were locked in.”As word had spread that the building was surrounded by police, a young DJ who was on the decks at the time, Rob Tissera, decided to take action. “I got on the microphone, and very stupidly and regrettably, said: ‘If you want to keep the party going, we’re gonna have to fight the bastards.’” People did just that. “Everybody turned into bloody hooligans,” he says. “It ended in a three-hour siege and got pretty nasty.” A van was moved against the shutters to block police from coming in, and objects were thrown at them out of the windows, as the authorities even tried using a forklift truck to pry open the steel shutters. “It was a full-on riot,” says Winterbottom. Eventually the police got in and grabbed every single person, all 836 of them, resulting in one of the biggest mass arrests in UK history.That day, 35 years ago, was a pivotal moment in UK dance music, and one that had perhaps been brewing for some time. This was the era after 1988’s “second summer of love”: house and techno were powering a grassroots rave scene that was outraging the tabloids and facing a crackdown from police.Winterbottom had been part of a crew in Blackburn throwing illegal warehouse parties but, she says, “We couldn’t get one going there any more, the police were too heavy.” So they found a spot in Gildersome on an industrial estate. Tissera had been DJing a wedding earlier that evening in Manchester, where the father of the groom had given him a stern telling off for playing too much rave, and then he headed over. “There were hundreds of cars going from the north-west to Leeds, so I followed the convoy,” he recalls. Things had become so clandestine by this point that sound systems had to be built on-site to avoid detection, and decks were brought in covertly in ski holdalls.Things began normally enough but soon there was a feeling something was off. It’s estimated there were about 2-3,000 ravers outside trying to get in but they had been stopped by a police operation involving roadblocks, dogs, searchlights and helicopters. Around 5am, after the hours-long standoff, police got in. “The crowd were running around the warehouse in sheer terror,” says Winterbottom, who also says she witnessed her female friend knocked unconscious by a police truncheon (West Yorkshire police did not offer comment for this piece). “The whole thing was so scary. It was such a violent confrontation. You couldn’t escape.”The police pulled people outside in groups of about 20, put them into vans and sent them off to various stations to book them. Most were later sent home and back to their normal lives with just a caution, but not Tissera. “They did a dawn raid on my house and scooped me up,” he says. “They took me to Halifax police station and said, ‘We’ve got a video nasty that we want to play you.’” It turns out there was video footage that had captured his incendiary words to the crowd. “When I saw what it was: hands up, guilty as charged, there was no way around it.”He thought he was going to get off. “My barrister said I was going to get a fine and a suspended sentence,” he says. “I was due to go to Corfu to DJ the following day. When the judge made me stand up for my punishment it was completely unexpected and it changed the course of my life. The verdict made my eyeballs shake. I almost fell over.” Tissera was sentenced to three months in prison for inciting a riot and the dishonest abstraction of electricity.A new law had very recently been put into place by the MP Graham Bright. The Entertainment (Increased Penalties) Act of 1990 meant that organisers of unlicensed events could now be jailed for up to six months or fined heavily. With Bright himself present in court, Tissera feels he was made an example of. “And so it was off to Armley jail [now HMP Leeds],” he says. “It was proper Victorian: two bunk beds and a bucket. It was quite unpleasant – I saw people getting slashed in there.” Thankfully, an experienced and avuncular cellmate looked after him and he came out unscathed. If anything, it did his reputation the world of good and the DJ bookings came flying in. “It definitely helped,” he says. “It became a bit of a folklore thing that you were the guy who went to jail for acid house. It gave me credibility. However, I should never have said something so stupid.”It was a line-in-the-sand moment for many when it came to illegal warehouse parties. “It was a sure sign that this was the end,” says Winterbottom. “You couldn’t get anything off the ground. Even a little party in the woods for 50 people would get busted.” Many people left that world altogether: some went legit as dance music moved into a new era of commercialism, while others joined forces with the traveller community and moved the free party scene outdoors. “That was the turning point,” says Tissera, who has become a career DJ. “That incident really shaped what came next.”However, despite the fear, chaos and violence of that day, it has done nothing to taint the memories of that era and those wild, uninhibited raves when they were in full swing. “It was such an experience to live through all of it,” says Winterbottom, who is writing a book about Blackburn raves. “The parties were amazing, [they outweighed] the violence we suffered. I could never regret a moment of it.”"

    "content": "‘The joy he was experiencing was infectious’Brann Dailor, drums/vocals, MastodonMy introduction to Sabbath was my mom’s band, who used to cover War Pigs – a pretty faithful rendition! But Ozzy felt more like my discovery, in 1981 or so. I was six years old, a neighbour had Blizzard of Ozz and I would just would stare at that album cover. I fell in love. The Randy Rhoads guitar solos, and then you would see footage of Ozzy and he looked as if he was having the time of his life up there. For a kid, he almost seemed like a cartoon character; the joy he was experiencing was infectious, but also the music was visceral. He became my favourite musician. I had a boombox next to my bed with the Tribute live album on at a low volume so nobody in the house would wake up, and I’d go to sleep to Ozzy every night.There’s something about his vocal phrasing, a timbre that’s so perfectly matched with the music that’s playing underneath. He had the ability to emote and tell a story and draw you in, and the melodies he chose were really special. I don’t think he got enough credit as a singer – to the layperson he was this madman, and to them, the magic lay there and not in his abilities. But the way he sang was so unique and powerful. It’s so ingrained in my mind that when I listen back to stuff that I’ve done in Mastodon, when I sing, I can tell that it’s so heavily influenced by him. I like big, heavy riffs with an almost evil-sounding, dark, high-pitched vocal tonality: that’s Ozzy to a T.I met him at Ozzfest in 2005: I had got a Randy Rhoads [tribute] drum kit made, and he, Sharon and Zakk Wylde came over in a golf cart to look at it. But I usually kept my distance just because I’m such a huge fan and didn’t want to get in the way.Then Mastodon got to play Back to the Beginning [Ozzy and Black Sabbath’s farewell concert on 5 July]. Some icons of music, they didn’t know when it was their last show – take Prince, for instance. And so it was really, really special [for them to perform a definitive final show]. Mastodon were on first and I was unsure if it was going to be just a couple of people in the crowd when we played. But we were driving to the stadium, passing all the pubs, and they were filled with people and you could hear Sabbath blasting out of them at 9.30am. And then we got there and all the bands, from Metallica to Slayer to Anthrax, are at the side of the stage, they want to see us do our thing. It was this really palpable energy, this big feeling of love for Black Sabbath, to honour them the proper way.But then you knew that the big moment was looming: Ozzy’s gonna play. This is the last time you’re gonna hear Crazy Train. [Dailor begins crying.] Mr Crowley, the beginning, the organ, it was so powerful. Everybody was crying. It was just like, oh my God, this is the last time we’re going to see this. Then Tony’s guitar, Geezer’s bass – he was ripping, it was insane – and Bill’s drums. Those four super-special guys doing their thing. The gravity of the moment hit everybody at the same time, that this is it. It was a beautiful moment to be in.Sabbath were so influential because they were so riff-centric, and that just really didn’t exist before. You had some bands that were close to it – but nobody really took that leap into the sound of horror. Like with Led Zeppelin, it got kind of dark; with Deep Purple, there were some moments. Something was swirling around in the air – but Black Sabbath realised it. They knew people were lining up to go and see these scary movies, these Hammer films, and they wanted to get scared. They knew that could be a real wealth of inspiration, to really tap into this darkness that exists out there and inside of everyone, but also in a playful way.That darkness that you chase, that thing that resonates inside of you, it’s the devil’s chord – it just makes you feel something. If we’re composing something [in Mastodon], and it’s not evil enough, I’d rather it be more evil, please; we need to find different notes because this sounds too happy and I don’t like that. I love being happy, but the darkness makes me happier, somehow. Like Ozzy, I grew up in an industrial area – Rochester, New York – and it’s not all sunshine and happiness and roses. That’s not what’s happening in real life. And if you’re writing about sunshine and rainbows all the time, you’re kidding yourself. [Heavy metal] helps to try to unpack it and understand why some of the terrible things happen in the world, and it helps you get through it.‘I adored how much he loved the Beatles’Sam Carter, vocals, ArchitectsOzzy Osbourne was such a beautiful soul. He basically created metal as a genre, and we’re all so grateful to him for that. I also adored how much he loved the Beatles – as a Beatles superfan myself, I always used him as proof that without the Beatles, there would be no Sabbath and no Ozzy.He gave people like me the belief that I could become a touring musician, too. He showed us that if you care enough and work hard enough, you can make it – and you can do it without being a dickhead, but with a smile on your face. I will always be grateful to have had him as an idol.‘They call him the Prince of Darkness, but maybe he’s a bit bigger than that now’Lita Ford, guitar, the RunawaysThe first concert I ever saw in my life was Black Sabbath at the Long Beach Arena in California, in 1971, when I was 12. The place was packed, just unlike anything I had ever seen. The guys in the band had this long thick black hair – you couldn’t even see them for all the blackness, though you could see these big gold crosses that they would wear. Along with the music and the power that was coming off the stage, they were the coolest thing ever. It absolutely carved my future out for me. I thought: I want to make people feel like these guys are making me feel right now.I had already been playing guitar for two years, but I started to live and breathe it. When I turned 14, I hitchhiked across California to go to the California Jam [festival]. The last thing you need to be doing as a young girl is hitchhiking, but I had to go. I was able to work my way into a hole through the fence, next thing I know I’m right in front of the stage. Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Emerson, Lake & Palmer … A lot of the things you hear Ozzy sing are not easy, but some of the high notes, he seemed to hit them effortlessly. His voice has so much character, it’s haunting, almost a cry.And then I ended up having a hit solo single with him in 1988. Sharon Osbourne was my manager and she came by the studio I was recording in, in North Hollywood, with Ozzy. Ozzy and I went into a little side room and just started pinging ideas back and forth. Nothing was pre-recorded; he didn’t have a title, I didn’t have a riff. We were in there all night, because when we came out of that room, the sun was coming up. That was Close My Eyes Forever: magic was created in that room, and who would have thought it would have been such a huge song [reaching No 8 in the US charts].With Sharon being my manager, Ozzy was always there. They were crazy. The stuff they did to each other – it wasn’t like any other relationship I’ve ever known. They were perfect for each other, that’s for sure, because he could dish it out and she could dish it out even bigger. She and Ozzy would play games with each other to let the other know they’ve pissed them off. You’d walk through a hotel and you’d see a pair of shoes out in the hallway, and you’d think: I wonder why Ozzy’s shoes are there? Well, Sharon had had enough of him, and she’d crapped in his shoes. And then of course he would crap in her shoes at a later date. He’d get her back.They came to my parents’ house one day for Easter dinner, and my mom had roasted a leg of lamb. Sharon and Ozzy come in, and Ozzy chugs a bottle of wine. He doesn’t drink the wine in a glass, he just drinks it out of the bottle, like it’s the last little bit of fluid he’s ever going to taste. And he starts sinking lower and lower into the chair until the wine’s gone. And then my father asks Ozzy to cut the lamb. Ozzy starts, but it slips off the plate and goes underneath the table. Ozzy says: “I’m sorry, I don’t eat meat!” My dad laughed his ass off.He’s the biggest, greatest rock star in the world. Right up to everything he did in the past month, doing the concert. Whether he could stand up and walk or not, he still delivered the songs, and the band killed it. I hate to say it, but it’s kind of the way to go: like a king. They call him the Prince of Darkness, but maybe he’s a bit bigger than that now.‘It’s absolutely disarming, the way he’s delivering his truth’Joe Duplantier, vocals/guitar, GojiraThe way he departed this world was absolutely magnificent. Raising all that money for charity with Back to the Beginning, bringing the whole scene together like this – and then he’s gone. It is very sad and at the same time, so perfect in a way.Back to the Beginning was like taking a picture of what the metal scene is. Of course Iron Maiden weren’t around; a lot of English bands were missing. But Slayer, Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax … all these people that mean so much. We’ve played thousands of shows, had so many important shows, but this one takes the cake. It is way more powerful than even the Olympic Games performance that we did last year. There was no competition involved like in the Olympics – this was art, spirituality, emotions. And everybody knew they were seeing Ozzy for the last time. I cried.There’s a purity to the lyrics he sings, and to his attitude. It’s absolutely disarming, the way he’s delivering his truth and saying that he’s going to do whatever he wants to do. The world is yours – you just have to decide it. The song Under the Sun that we covered at Back to the Beginning was very much like that, and I’m pretty sure he influenced a lot of the punk and thrash scenes with that speech, which is basically: fuck you, I’m going to be myself. It’s so basic, but so needed in our societies. Whenever [Gojira] talk about environment or equality between people or doing the right thing, it’s with this attitude, an attitude that is typical Ozzy.Before we knew he had died we were playing a show in Istanbul. It’s almost impossible to catch us playing a cover version – we’re proud like that, we’re French, we want to do our thing. But that day in Istanbul, we had decided to play Under the Sun. During the show, one of the fans in the front row put “Rest In Peace Ozzy” on his phone and held it up to me. That’s how I learned that Ozzy died. I checked with my tour manager on the side of the stage and they confirmed it. So I went to the microphone and told 9,000 people the news. Everybody stayed completely silent. The whole show shifted to a very deep tone. And at the end, we played the cover and there was a lot of emotion and a lot of people crying. It’s beyond words what I felt: one of the most epic moments in my life. I have children, I witnessed their birth, that would be number one for sure. But being on stage and playing a Black Sabbath song with everybody as one … in the lyrics he says: “I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die.” I believe in a sort-of afterlife, and I was imagining him on his way there as I was singing that line.At Back to the Beginning, it was amazing to see people being so supportive of this guy and this lifestyle and whatever it generates and communicates. There’s something in this genre that brings people together and gives hope. It’s a secret code: I see a metalhead in Japan or Turkey or Greece and we just know: we’re rooting for truth and we’re rooting for power. But the good power, the power that you find in a volcano or in a wave. And pointing at things that society won’t look at, but metal does. Metal talks about pain, suffering, blood, and death: the one thing we all have in common. It’s not a political party, it’s not a religion, it’s this thing that we share, and we think more people should join and share that.‘I was in a room with him just 10 days ago’Randy Blythe, vocals, Lamb of GodThe guys in Sabbath didn’t walk around saying: we created heavy metal. But those of us who play music in this genre pretty universally point to Black Sabbath as the first metal band. We had toured with the original lineup before, we toured with Ozzy before, and we were very cognisant of the fact that we were invited to play with the creators. So getting to play their final show was just a tremendous honour and pretty overwhelming for all the band.His death is a very odd thing because all of us are still very much on a high from the concert, and I was in a room with him just 10 days ago, at Comic-Con, his last public appearance. He was really full of life and happiness over the whole Back to the Beginning thing. I was thanking him for the show, for having Lamb of God, and I’m like: “Oh, we went by 154 Lodge Road.” Because me and my lady and Ozzy’s agent went to see Ozzy’s childhood home: a tiny little terrace house in Aston. I told Ozzy and he gave me a big smile: “I bet that fucking guy who lives there is sick of hearing about me!” And he just busted out laughing. He was in a really good mood; he went out on a high note. His death is very sad, but my heart is full, because I got to witness him say goodbye to his fans. He said it a few years ago: if I can just play one more show and drop dead at the end, I’ll die as a happy man. So he got to do that.In 2012, I was in prison in Prague [Blythe was charged with manslaughter after a Lamb of God fan died from a fall off stage, and he was later acquitted]. I had paid bail, over $200,000. But the prosecuting attorney apparently did not like the fact that I had been given bail, he made some sort of objection, and I wasn’t released. So Ozzy and Sharon both said things via social media in support of me, but more importantly, they wrote a letter to the judge attesting to my character and offering to throw an Ozzfest concert in Prague, the proceeds from which would go to any desired charity. They didn’t ask them to find me not guilty, they just wanted them to honour my bail. It’s not cheap to put on an Ozzfest, so the fact that they were willing to do that, and stick up for a member of their extended musical family, speaks volumes to their character.When I was in prison, I didn’t have access to English newspapers or the internet. I came out into the prison yard one day, and all these dudes came up to me, speaking in broken English, very excited and impressed. “Ozzy Osbourne says good things for you.” When you’re in a foreign prison, and people are stoked that Ozzy is speaking up for you, it makes a difference. I’ll always be grateful for that.Ozzy was not a pitch-perfect singer. He was not some Auto-Tuned product; there was a great humanity to his voice. The most important thing is his voice was singular, and a bit unhinged. A couple of times I’ve even confused a Led Zeppelin song with someone else because the vocals were similar enough. That has never, ever happened with any Ozzy song.‘Sabbath and Ozzy were a lesson in being yourself at all costs’Lzzy Hale, vocals/guitar, HalestormI remember a very early conversation with my parents about the difference between the music that you might hear at the grocery store where it’s kind of meant to fade in the background and not really be noticed, and rock’n’roll, and specifically Black Sabbath, that is meant to stop you in your tracks. From a very early age, that was the kind of music that I was attracted to. There’s a rite of passage, specifically for a woman who is attracted to that type of music: I lost a lot of friends, but Sabbath and Ozzy were a lesson in being yourself at all costs. You’re not doing it to be well liked, but because it is essentially a part of who you are. So many of the mission statements for our songs go back to that foundation.It’s actually been a shock to find out that he is mortal, because Ozzy was meant to live for ever. He’d survived so much in the business and been through drugs, alcohol, the quad bike accident [that nearly killed him in 2003] and illness, but he had so much love in his heart up till the end and was still hungry for it and doing it for the right reasons. When we played the Back to the Beginning final show, he was visibly frustrated that he couldn’t get out of the chair. There was a moment where it looked as if he was going to get up as if he was thinking: “Dude, I have wings.” Ultimately it’s about what we leave behind, how many many smiles we create and how much love we pass on, and what a wonderful man Ozzy was for all of that.‘I was a little worse for wear but in comparison to the Sabbath guys I was an Olympic athlete’Rick Wakeman, keyboards, YesYes ended up supporting Sabbath on a big American tour, and I hit it off with them right from the beginning. We were drinkers and kindred spirits in that we loved the social aspect. I ended up – much to the disdain of the Yes guys – travelling with Ozzy, Tony, Bill and Geezer on their own plane, surrounded by beer crates. It was brilliant. Ozzy said: “We’ve got some Minimoog lines that need doing, will you come and do it?” That’s how I got to play on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973).Yes were recording in studio three at Morgan Studios in north London and they were in studio two over the road. When I went over at about one o’clock in the morning I was a little worse for wear but in comparison to the Sabbath guys I was an Olympic athlete. The word “comatose” comes to mind. The only person who was compos mentis was the tape op, who was sort of terrified. He set the track up and I played what I thought was OK. Ozzy opened his eyes, said: “Fucking brilliant!” then he closed his eyes again. I think I ended up crashing there as well. There was even talk of me defecting to Sabbath but someone said: “We’ll lose what we have,” because at the time metal bands were all guitars and didn’t have keyboard players. I said: “One day that will change,” and it did. My son Adam ended up playing [keyboards] with Ozzy for 20 years and when he joined he asked me what I’d played on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. I said: “I can barely remember being there – can you let me know?”Some years after that I played on Ozzy’s Ozzmosis album (1995), which is still one of my favourite albums to this day. It’s almost prog metal. I certainly think most prog bands would have been delighted to have written a track like Perry Mason. That time, in the studio he was a lot more on the ball and much more knowledgable about what he wanted than people give him credit for. He was very clever at being the caricature of himself that the media wanted when they wanted it, but when it came down to music, he was a bright boy.I honestly think Sharon saved his life. I met them when they’d first got together on Ozzy’s first solo tour back in 1981 or something, which Sharon was production managing or something. I knew she was [the infamous music manager] Don Arden’s daughter and Ozzy said: “Rick, I can tell you because you’re a mate, but we’re an item.” I asked Sharon: “What does your dad think?” and she said: “He doesn’t know yet.” I wouldn’t want to have been in the room when they told him, but years later he said the only person that ever got one over on him was his daughter, because he’d taught her well. I’d never seen Ozzy so happy. Very few marriages don’t go through some sort of turmoil and theirs was very public, but they genuinely loved each other.I feel honoured to have worked with him. Ozzy sang Buried Alive on my Return to the Centre of the Earth album (1999) and did a fantastic job on it. I had the London Symphony Orchestra and he just thought it was great fun. A journalist asked him what he thought of the track, Oz went: “Fucking brilliant,” and that was the end of the interview. Ozzy could be hilarious, but had so many different sides and one of his endearing qualities for me is that he did a lot of really good things for charities and such, but didn’t wave a flag about it. Sharon was the same. They just got on and did it, which is how it should be. I’m going to miss him a lot even though I didn’t see him that much, but in a strange way he’ll never go away. People will always keep telling stories about him and I think that’s the legacy he’d like to leave.‘The riffs, the solos, the songs – it just oozed metal’Scott Ian, guitar/lyrics, AnthraxWhen Anthrax came together in the early 80s, we had all grown up with Sabbath – no Sabbath, no Anthrax. And then Ozzy comes out with these two genre-defining and -expanding solo records, with this new hot guitar player Randy Rhoads, and the riffs, the solos, the songs – it just oozed metal. Everything he did was such an influence on us.I wouldn’t have even become a guitar player if it wasn’t for Sabbath. After taking guitar lessons for six months and being bored with my teacher trying to make me learn theory, all I wanted to do was listen to Sabbath and Zeppelin and learn how to play those songs. And so when he wouldn’t help me do that, I stopped lessons, and I would sit and listen to Sabbath records and learn the chords by ear. That’s literally how I learned how to play guitar.Ozzy was right up at the top of our list of guys we wanted a singer to sound like. Most of our peers, they all had vocalists who were shouters or yellers: James Hetfield, Tom Araya, Dave Mustaine, Paul Baloff, you could even put Lemmy in that category. The vision we always had for Anthrax was we wanted a singer, more in the vein of someone like Ozzy or Bruce Dickinson or Rob Halford, a voice that could be really aggressive but also really melodic at the same time.Sabbath’s lyrics, people think of witches and demons, but so much had to do with the horrors of war. They grew up in postwar Birmingham, one of the most bombed places in the country. They had front-row seats to that, the savagery of it. On that first Anthrax record I wrote lyrics for, Spreading the Disease, there are lyrics about war, about being a disenfranchised teenager and having to fight for everything you have, about organised religion, which was all in me from listening to Sabbath records. I saw that there was a bigger world than my mother’s apartment in Bayside, Queens, and Sabbath was one of those things that opened that door for me, along with Stephen King or Marvel Comics. It opened my mind and it helped me use my imagination.Just so much of Sabbath still holds up, lyrically. They all saw, at a very young age, that the world was not a friendly place. And the powers that be are only in it for themselves. War Pigs: that song came out when Vietnam was still raging, but could it be more prescient now?I met Ozzy in 1988 when he took Anthrax on tour in the US for two months. Every band that would open for Ozzy on these giant arena tours would then blow up in popularity – Mötley Crüe, Metallica, and it was the same for us. I’d say the deepest conversation I had with him was about AC/DC’s Bon Scott – it’s very rare to meet somebody who actually got to hang out with Bon. I said: what was he like? He thought about it for a second, and goes: “Now, Bon, he was a drinker.” Coming from Ozzy, that sets the bar pretty high.We had a different experience than, say, seven years earlier when he was still the bat-biting, dove-head-ripper-offer. He would pop his head through the door of our dressing room backstage and go: “You alright, mates? You need anything? Don’t bother talking to the crew people, just come see me and I’ll take care of it.” And that was every day. His kids were running around backstage – the world was a different place for him at that point. It’s one of those amazing things that when you meet your hero and he’s better than you can hope for.‘He’d order a quadruple brandy and neck it’Mick Box, guitar, Uriah HeepHe always had top-notch players with him – he even had three members of Uriah Heep [Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake and John Sinclair]. So, when we were recording our 1982 album Abominog in the Roundhouse studios, he was constantly popping down there and having a drink with us at the pub across the road. He’d order a quadruple brandy and I’d think: oh, it’s going to be one of them nights. He’d leave it there on the bar for quite a while, going on talking and joking, and then he’d just turn around and neck it. He said: “I hate the taste of it, I like what it does to me.” When you’re in his company, you’re always laughing; he’s just one of those characters. He did take the world quite seriously, on conspiracy theories and things like that at one point – but generally, there was just a funny side in everything.I like his later stuff, like [his debut solo album] Blizzard of Ozz. It rocked the heavy metal world, knocked it on its breeches, because it was that good. Being fired from Sabbath, I guess there was a degree of floundering about, but when that lineup came together, it really did take him into the stratosphere.If you’re looking at great [rock and metal] singers, you’d say Ronnie James Dio: a beautiful, creamy, lovely voice. But Ozzy had an equal to that in his own way: very powerful, and very recognisable, which is almost as important as anything else in music. There’ll never be another character like him. He was the godfather of everything, basically.‘He reminded me of a hobbit – he had this beautiful whimsical side’Eleanor Livingston, vocals/guitar, Die SpitzMy dad introduced me to Black Sabbath and Blizzard of Ozz when I was really young. I would run around in my underwear and listen to Crazy Train; Mr Crowley was my favourite Ozzy song when I was a kid. When I was 10 I saw him live at the Moody Amphitheater in Austin [Texas]. There was this giant bucket of water on stage and between songs he would dunk his head fully in and you’d see the water splash out. That image stayed with me.When we started a band at the first show we ever did we played Paranoid, because it was the easiest one to play, but I’ve probably learned the riffs to at least 15 Sabbath songs. We were hugely influenced by Sabbath and in terms of performance, I always wanted that crazy fun attitude that Ozzy had. It always felt he wanted to create a world that people couldn’t be part of, but his soul was very gentle: he’d always say “God bless you” during shows and he was always talking about his children. He reminded me of a hobbit, and had this beautiful whimsical side. The biggest thing he taught me was that it’s OK to look how you want to and do your own thing, and not to doubt myself.It surprises people that we make the music we do because we’re women, but I’m not going to present myself as a pretty, meek girl or whatever. He presented himself as a freak and as much as people hated him initially, he made that iconic. There was a video of ours that went kinda viral where I’m hopping like a frog, and then I rewatched this Sabbath show from Paris in the 70s and Ozzy was hopping like a frog and generally being insane, and I thought: “Ah, that’s where it came from.” He influenced my dad, then me and I’m sure if I ever have kids I’ll tell them about him. He truly was one of a kind.‘There was a childlike playfulness that he carried on stage’Matt Baty, vocals, Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs PigsThe blueprint for our band was heavily influenced by Sabbath, in the way that we wanted to tread that line between something quite heavy and serious-sounding, but counterpoint that with something celebratory and triumphant. And have music that people could, when it’s performed live, just completely enter into another world with. There’s amazing mental health benefits to that – like even just being a member of an audience going to see like a band that I love, if they can make me switch off for an hour and just kind of trample down all of those like horrible racing thoughts on a day-to-day basis, that’s magic.I also like to add to balance out the doom with a bit of a bit more of a positive message, or at least the message of: we’re in this together. Even when you think about [Osbourne’s 1980 debut solo single] Crazy Train, there’s that line that I absolutely love: “Millions of people living as foes but maybe it’s not too late to learn how to love and forget how to hate”. How beautiful is that? And it’s in a metal song.I’ve thought about that final performance quite a bit in the past couple of weeks because one of the things that struck me about Ozzy was even though he was sat down, he was still commanding the stage. You would hear a huge cheer from the audience just via him pulling particular faces. The greatest performers are the ones that can express themselves emotionally in a genuine way like that. As soon as things kind of become huge productions in huge arenas, performances can become, well, performative. Whereas Ozzy, he always felt genuine; there was a childlike playfulness that he carried on stage that was very endearing.There’s a live in Paris video from 1970, and I absolutely love that performance – he’s out of this world as a vocalist on that. And then California Jam, 1974, it’s incredible. It looks as if they’re playing in front of like a million people. They play Children of the Grave and there’s a dichotomy to it – it’s called Children of the Grave, right? But it’s a really celebratory and uplifting song. I’ve just put it on now: Ozzy’s wearing some gorgeous tassels.His singing is just so expressive – especially in that the earlier Sabbath catalogue, there’s no tricks to it, like straight-up blues singing, in a way. Incredibly emotive and quite raw. Rock and metal today, I find quite a lot of it quite formulaic sometimes, both the performance and the production of it. It loses a lot of character – and you could never really throw that accusation at Ozzy.The catalogue’s there; Ozzy and Sabbath are never going to be forgotten. And they’ll keep inspiring future generations of musicians to pick up a guitar or microphone and express themselves. One of the important things was they were always very open about their background as well: they came from nothing. Today there’s not a lot of hope for people in certain areas of the country, and you don’t see a lot of breakthrough artists that are truly working class – that’s a shame. Access to instruments, lessons, rehearsal spaces and the affordability of all of those things; even a pair of drumsticks now is about 15 quid. But I hope that there are kids that could look at a band like Sabbath and think: “Well, they just did it. They just got together and did it.”"

    "source": "The Guardian",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/24/bounce-legend-big-freedia-gospel-album-beyonce-god-gay",
    "published": "2025-08-01T06:45:48.598354+00:00",
    "content": "On stage at Nashville Pride festival on a sweltering June afternoon, Big Freedia is her usual boisterously commanding self. She invites volunteers and the sign-language interpreter to join her and her dancers in getting down to bounce music, the relentlessly kinetic style of hip-hop for which she has become a figurehead in her native New Orleans. Then she pauses for a brief heart-to-heart with the audience. “I don’t know if y’all know this, but I started in the church,” she says.Big Freedia’s forthcoming album, Pressing Onward, is a gospel record and she is keen to stress that she isn’t abandoning her core audience. The gay, gender-fluid rapper and reality TV star exhorts every kind of body to shake it and is unequivocal about her support for all marginalised people; her reputation led Beyoncé and Drake to sample her on some of their most successful tracks. “This album is for us,” she emphasises. “It is for people who are LGBTQ and who love God.”When the beat of a new song, Take My Hand, kicks into double time, just the way a sanctified rhythm section would in church, she brings gospel catharsis to queer people in the same southern state where the US supreme court recently upheld a ban on transgender youth healthcare, at a time when LGBTQ+ progress across the US is meeting with forceful religious pushback.The week after, Big Freedia logs on to our video call to talk gospel. “It’s already an ass revival when they come to a Big Freedia show,” she says, referring to the mass twerking her shows inspire. “And now they’re coming to a Big Freedia gospel revival.”In one sense, it’s a superficial distinction. Back in the church choir of Big Freedia’s youth, she moved people to ecstatic dance: “We would have lots of clapping, stomping of the feet, choreographed dancing that we would do in our robes.” The young singer, who back then could hit soprano range, showed such dedication and promise that the choir’s director made her their assistant. By high school, Big Freedia was leading ensembles and envisioned that as her future. “I thought I was going to be a famous choir director and that I was gonna be singing with choirs all around the world.”Big Freedia says she grew up feeling welcomed by the working-class Black Baptist congregation that knew her as Freddie Ross Jr – so much so that she used its name as the title of her new album. “From the first time I walked in the doors, they put their arms around me and gave me the biggest hug,” she says. “And they knew I was a young gay boy. I was loud and proud, even as a kid. We didn’t have those moments of the pastor talking about: ‘God doesn’t love gay folks.’ God loved us all.”She was also becoming part of a circle of rappers that were making boastful, bass-heavy New Orleans club music a vehicle for their party-starting queer and gender-expansive personae. The bounce scene beckoned. Big Freedia received assurance from her mum and other church folk that pursuing it wouldn’t be sacrilegious, as long as she maintained her relationship with God – and she lets it be known, loudly and often, that she has. Before she took the stage at Pride, her team huddled and someone offered a prayer: “God give Freedia the supernatural strength, in the name of Jesus, from the top of her head to the soles of her feet.”Big Freedia certainly isn’t the first member of the LGBTQ+ community to contribute to the gospel canon. That lineage might be more widely acknowledged if generations of the music’s pioneers hadn’t been required to live closeted lives. “Once you start historicising, you figure out that so much of what is sung in churches was created by, and continues to be created by, queer folks,” says Ashon Crawley, a religious studies scholar and cultural critic who draws on insight he gained as a young, Black, queer Pentecostal church musician.In her youth, Big Freedia recorded with the New Orleans Gospel Soul Children choir, but she had never contemplated her own gospel project until a 2024 session yielded the spiritually ebullient dance track Celebration. “God put it on my heart that this is what I need to do,” she says. Big Freedia made clear to potential co-writers that she still wanted her audacious swagger and compassion to come through and that she wasn’t out to convert anyone. “I’m representing for the LGBTQ community,” she told them. “So when they come here, the door is bust wide open and there is no judgment and you have this moment to lose it in the spirit.”Parson James, a Nashville-based pop artist who is queer and biracial, helped her craft some of the hooks. He had dealt with the homophobia of his small-town South Carolina congregation by distancing himself from the church and its music, so he was wary of returning to gospel, but he put his trust in Big Freedia’s intentions. “Doing it with someone who’s so confident – you can’t tell her shit – it just was amazing.”Pressing Onward has ample pop accessibility: over an 808 drum machine, Sunday Best blends hip-hop fashion flexes and brags about Black church finery. But the album is also lifted by unmistakable gospel elements: warm, reverberant eruptions of Hammond B3 organ; the taut, powerful unison of mass choir singing. Crawley sees Big Freedia’s reclamation of these traditions as potentially subversive. “It demonstrates to the church: your excluding of us doesn’t have to be the end of our story; we find community with one another in ways that you both taught us how to do and in ways you could not anticipate. So perhaps you should pay more attention to the very thing that you have excluded.”Big Freedia initially planned to release Pressing Onward in June’s Pride month, but in May her longtime partner, Devon Hurst, died unexpectedly of diabetes complications. She insisted on directing the choir at his funeral. The day before our interview, she closed on the house they had planned to buy together. “My whole life has just changed within this last month,” she says. “It has been an emotional rollercoaster, all the things that me and him had planned and the things we were doing and working on. And now I’m doing all these things by myself.”Even in her profound grief, she was willing to push the album release back only by a month. “I need it more than anybody,” she says. “And I know if I need it, there’s other people out there in the world that need it. There’s always someone who’s depressed or going through a hard time. There is always someone who’s fighting who they are, or fighting against a community of people that don’t accept who they are. This album is not just for me – it’s for the world.” Pressing Onward is released via Queen Diva Music on 8 August"

    "author": "The Guardian",

    "content": "Tom Lehrer, the acclaimed humorist and pianist whose satirical songs made him one of America’s favorite prophets of doom before he retreated to academia, has died, US media reported on Sunday. He was 97.The singer-songwriter died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his friend David Herder said, according to the New York Times.Lehrer’s sardonic numbers, backed up by a dazzling prowess at the piano that reflected his love for up-tempo Broadway show tunes, enchanted audiences in the 1950s and 60s.But Lehrer was always much more than the sum of his parts. A child prodigy, he graduated from Harvard at 19 and later taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Well ahead of his time on issues including pollution and nuclear proliferation, Lehrer made his mark with biting humor and zany rhymes.He was also wickedly funny on random subjects including murder, conjugal discord and chemistry.Poisoning Pigeons in the Park, one of his signature tunes, conjures up a couple enjoying a spring pastime of slaughtering pigeons with strychnine – “It just takes a smidgen!” Underlying the song was the Boston authorities’ method of pigeon control, using strychnine-treated corn.Another song, Folksong Army, mocked 1960s protesters.But his activism was persistent, with songs including Who’s Next about nuclear weapons, and Pollution warning that: “You can use the latest toothpaste, then rinse your mouth with industrial waste.”The seemingly bottomless well of sly, even cynical creativity captured audiences from 1953 until it appeared to go dry in 1965, although Lehrer briefly returned to performing in 1972 for a children’s public television show, The Electric Company.Rumor had it that Lehrer stopped composing when his prophecies began coming true, or that he quit in protest over Henry Kissinger being awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1973.But Lehrer, in an interview with the satirical news website the Onion in 2000, dispensed with the second rumor, saying he had “quit long before that happened”.There was nothing abrupt about it, he said. “I figure I wrote 37 songs in 20 years, and that’s not exactly a full-time job. Every now and then I wrote something, and every now and then I didn’t. The second just outnumbered the first.”He claimed to have gone “from adolescence to senility, trying to bypass maturity”.While most of Lehrer’s compositions were original, one adaptation stood out for its genius: his dizzying 1959 recitation of the chemical elements in the periodic table (102 at the time) to the tune of A Modern Major General from the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Pirates of Penzance.The piece earned adoration from none other than the Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe.“Tom Lehrer in my opinion is the cleverest and funniest man of the 20th century, and he’s kind of my hero,” Radcliffe said, before singing a rendition of The Elements on a British comedy show in 2010.That performance was partly responsible for the music comedian Weird Al Yankovic awarding Radcliffe the role of Weird Al in Yankovic’s satirical biopic.“Singing that song is an extremely nerdy thing to do,” Yankovic said of Radcliffe’s rendition. “It’s off-the-charts nerdy. And I thought, ‘OK, this guy gets it. This guy’s a kindred spirit. He can embody me onscreen.’”Posting to Instagram on Sunday, Yankovic wrote: “My last living musical hero is still my hero but unfortunately no longer living. RIP to the great, great Mr. Tom Lehrer.”Born on 9 April 1928 to a secular Jewish family, Lehrer grew up in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. He attended the prestigious Horace Mann and Loomis Chaffee preparatory schools before entering Harvard at 15, graduating magna cum laude with a degree in mathematics three years later.He went on to teach mathematics at MIT as well as Harvard, Wellesley College and the University of California, Santa Cruz. This article was amended on 28 July 2025 to give 102 as the number of chemical elements in Tom Lehrer’s 1959 song about the periodic table. An earlier version gave 118. Context was also added for a reference to the song Poisoning Pigeons in the Park."

    "content": "How do you switch over from Spotify to another music service? What are the options?The music industry has long held mixed feelings about Spotify’s extensive influence over artists – and these feelings have intensified amid ongoing controversy over Spotify’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, leading a €600m (A$1.07bn) investment in Helsing, a German defence technology company specialising in AI-driven autonomous weapon systems.Ek is also chair of Helsing, having joined the board in 2021 when his investment fund Prima Materia put €100m into the then-startup.In response to Ek’s investment, artists and listeners have been seeking alternatives.“Fuck Spotify,” the prolific Australian psychedelic rock group King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard said in a social media post on Saturday, announcing they would be removing their catalogue from the streaming service. They followed US bands Xiu Xiu and Deerhoof, who made the same decision in recent weeks.Whether you’re motivated by joining artists in leaving Spotify, or you’re just interested in seeing the alternatives, it can seem daunting to make the switch after years of being with the service.But it is really easy. Streaming services tend to not have lock-in contracts, so if you’re looking to switch, the first step would be cancelling your existing subscription through the account settings. Depending on when you d, you’ll be able to keep the premium features until the next payment is due.So what are the options?1. Apple MusicWhen Apple Music launched, it felt clunky and limited. But it has come a long way in the past few years, with vast improvements to its functionality, music selection (over 100m songs), radio, playlists and other features such as music videos which Spotify doesn’t have.The user experience now seems much closer to Spotify. Apple also has launched lossless and spatial audio for a better listening quality. Lossless audio is something Spotify promised in 2021 but has not launched.If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem this is definitely the best option, but there is also an Android app.Apple offers one month for free to new users but after that subscriptions are A$12.99 (US$10.99 and £10.99) a month, with family plans at A$19.99 (US$16.99 and £16.99) a month. There are also bundled subscription deals with Apple’s other services, such as iCloud storage and Apple TV+.2. YouTube MusicIf you pay for a YouTube premium subscription – A$16.99 (US$13.99 and £12.99) a month – you get YouTube Music for free. It has over 100m songs and you get access to ad-free YouTube videos along with it. It also has playlists and radio stations and other features you would see elsewhere.As with Apple Music and its ecosystem, if you’re already an Android user, this is an easier option for you.3. Amazon MusicAmazon Music is included in Amazon Prime for A$9.99 (US$10.99 and £8.99) a month. This tier comes with over 100m songs, podcasts and playlists, but users who want a more deluxe experience may opt for the pricier category, Amazon Music Unlimited, for A$12.99 (US$11.99 and £11.99), separate from Prime membership. Unlimited comes with lossless and spatial audio tracks.If you want to avoid giving three of the largest tech companies your money, though, there are a growing number of other options.4. TidalTidal has always been pitched as the service that compensates artists the best and offers the highest audio quality. Like the other services, it has a catalogue of over 100m tracks. Pricing is A$12.99 (US$10.99 and £10.99) a month, with an optional add-on for DJs offering stem separation for tracks.In addition to high-quality audio and all the expected features, Tidal has more than 650,000 videos and concert live streams.Other non-major companies offering music listening alternatives include Bandcamp, Napster (yes, the former peer-to-peer filesharing service has gone legal), Qobuz and Pandora.Transferring playlistsThe biggest issue for people looking to switch is transferring your long-curated playlists. This is made easier through third-party services. If you want it to be fast you’ll have to pay but if you don’t have many to transfer or have the time, you can usually convert one playlist at a time for free.Popular options include the app SongShift (although it is only available on iOS) and Soundiiz (which runs in a web browser). You’ll need to give whichever app you choose access to the accounts you are switching over but you can remove access once you are done.The services will usually flag if a song on the playlist can’t be found. Sometimes it’s as simple as a mismatch with the exact name of the song and it can be found as a different mix or title.How well do the services pay artists?The companies tend to keep the information about how much they pay artists for each stream a closely guarded secret but a report from industry blog Trichordist in 2020 gives us a picture of the rough payments artists can expect.According to the report, Spotify pays US$0.00348 a stream, Apple Music pays US$0.00675 a stream, Amazon pays US$0.00426, Google pays US$0.00554 and Tidal pays US$0.00876. Surprisingly, the fitness company Peloton comes out on top of the list, paying US$0.03107 a stream. Napster also rates higher than others at US$0.00916.But if you want to support artists more directly, you can buy vinyl, or digital copies of the music through iTunes or similar services, or pay directly through Bandcamp or SoundCloud."

    "content": "Over the past year or so, you would have been hard pushed to read any of the New Eves’ interviews without feeling at least a little intrigued by what the Brighton quartet are reportedly up to. Said features usually discuss their onstage theatricality – there is talk of improvised dance and indeed “experimental ballet”, and of fake blood and their all-white homemade costumes, equal parts cottagecore and Midsommar. There are indications that the music the band make is merely part of a broader artistic practice that also involves painting, writing, photography and “traditional female crafts”, among them knitting.Then there’s mention of their curious instrumentation, in which violin, cello and flute have as much role to play as guitar, bass and drums. And there’s a frequent suggestion that the band are sonically sui generis: “We weren’t consciously inspired by any other musicians … it was like we created a new universe of paradise without even realising that’s what we were doing”; “The Velvet Underground are the only band I can compare us to – there’s a similar spirit there, but the New Eves aren’t about genre”.Claiming you are, as Duke Ellington liked to say, “beyond category” is part of any new band’s standard attention-grabbing arsenal. And in this case, in one sense at least, it isn’t true. Any alternative rock band who deploy strings to scrape and drone are almost inevitably going to attract some kind of comparison to the John Cale-era Velvet Underground. But, intentional or not, there are also plenty of other reference points you might reasonably mention to describe the music on the New Eves’ debut album The New Eve Is Rising.Something of the Raincoats’ rickety post-punk explorations seem to haunt its sound, albeit relocated from Notting Hill to a more pastoral setting. So does the lo-fi avant-garage rock of the early-80s Fall, which is audible amid the simple riffs and relentless drumming of Highway Man. There is occasionally a bleating quality about the vocals that automatically summons the ghost of Tyrannosaurus Rex-era Marc Bolan. Equally, at their most full throated, they recall the powerful but ascetic harmonies of folk family the Watersons. When the vocals tend to spoken word declamation – as on opener The New Eve – you might think not only of Patti Smith but those moments in Crass’s oeuvre when the microphone was ceded to Eve Libertine and Joy De Vivre.And yet, if there are plenty of artists other than the Velvet Underground whom you could compare the New Eves to – from trad folk to distaff anarcho-punk to hippy whimsy – the band’s central point still stands. Whatever ingredients went into the recipe, the result doesn’t ultimately sound like much else, and there is often something rather thrilling about being in its presence. The weird blend of glam drums, sawing strings and folky vocal roar on Cow Song, for example. Volcano’s slow surge from gentle fluting bucolia to a potent sense of menace. The moment on Rivers Run Red when the scrabble of strings and guitars dramatically finds an urgent percussive shape.It’s given an extra frisson by the fact that, whatever the circumstances of its recording, The New Eve Is Rising sounds as if it’s being played live, by a band who prize immediacy over virtuosity, with all the teetering potential for disaster that suggests. There’s a certain white-knuckle intensity to the moment when Circles shifts its rhythm, and given that the change is counted in with such vociferousness, perhaps it hasn’t always come off in the past.Said disaster never strikes, although you do occasionally wonder if something may have been lost in translation from live show to studio, despite their best efforts. The spoken-word manifesto of The New Eve probably feels more viscerally powerful delivered in front of your eyes than it does coming out of your speakers. But the moments when the album doesn’t quite work are tempered by the sense that this is a band still in a state of flux and progress, working out where they might go next – the “rising” in the title seems the operative word – rather than a perfectly finished product with all of the doubts about how to move on which that would entail. That the New Eves are overflowing with ideas is obvious from their interviews and their debut album alike. The latter presents them in rough hewn and occasionally chaotic style: it feels exciting, as does their future.What Alexis listened to this weekCate Le Bon – Is It Worth It (Happy Birthday)?An equivocal title for an equivocal song – the dreaminess of whose sound is undercut by a strange, sickly quality. It’s both addictive and slightly disturbing."

    "content": "It’s the only American radio show that’s been on the air for 100 years, an institution that launched the country music industry as we know it and a stage production that made country fans flock to Nashville in the first place – and keeps them coming for a singular experience today. “I somehow understood the weight of what I was stepping into,” says Marty Stuart of the Grand Ole Opry, specifically the first night he played in 1972 as a mandolin-playing prodigy sitting in with bluegrass star Lester Flatt’s band.Stuart went on to become a country star, and Opry member, himself, and has now embraced the role of elder on the show: on 26 September, he along with Luke Combs, Darius Rucker, Ashley McBryde and Carly Pearce will take part in the Opry’s first-ever overseas broadcast at the Royal Albert Hall, as part of a year-long 100th birthday celebration. “A hundred years of anything, especially in show business, it’s just unheard of,” he marvels.It has been a centrepiece in Stuart’s life for most of his 66 years: as a kid in small town Mississippi in the 1960s, he listened to Opry radio broadcasts from Nashville. By the early 90s, he was scoring hits as “a rhinestone-wearin’ country rock’n’roller”, and the Opry’s longtime legends – particularly fiddling balladeer Roy Acuff and comic personality Minnie Pearl – were nearing the end of their lives. Stuart sought their approval: “They had spent their lives building that institution, and I wanted to know that I was on the good side of the line with both of those folks.” Both did give him their blessing, but Pearl made him sweat first. She looked right past the armful of white roses he brought her, critiqued his attire – “Look at those tight pants!” – and admonished him to maintain the Opry’s good image.He kept the pants, but took her wishes to heart, and the basics of a night at the Opry’s downhome variety show have remained much the same. “It is not, on paper, the makings of a successful show,” laughs Dan Rogers, the Opry’s executive producer.Recorded and broadcast live in front of an audience, announcers project a mixture of folksy intimacy and professionalism as they welcome everyone, read sponsor ad messages and introduce world-class performers who do a few songs each, prioritising old chestnuts that they know fans want to hear. Any given night, the lineup may include mainstream country stars of the present and the distant past, bluegrass bands, gospel vocal groups, singer-songwriters, hotshot instrumentalists, down-home comedians, square dancers and more. Lineups often span several generations and are often described as one big family: back in March, the Opry’s most veteran member, 87-year-old Bill Anderson, appeared the same night that Stuart and his band the Fabulous Superlatives backed his bassist’s rockabilly obsessed, 10-year-old son.The Opry has absorbed a century’s worth of technological, musical and cultural evolution at a very measured pace. Its leadership has apologised for employing blackface duos in its early days; its traditional barn backdrop is now comprised of video walls and its stage has welcomed artists bringing hip-hop, gen-Z folk and TikTok virality to the genre. “You have to evolve,” says Rogers. “It’s a must for survival and for creating really interesting shows – but you do it in a way that’s really respectful of this institution.” Today, membership of the Opry, awarded to a small cadre of musicians – just 76 living artists – has become one of the industry’s greatest honours.The Opry was originally almost incidental programming on a radio station, WSM, launched in 1925 by National Life and Accident, a Nashville insurance company looking to promote its business. Station managers filled the airwaves with a hodgepodge of locally available acts, professional or not, and people soon began showing up to watch the broadcast. “It was a matter of: let’s see who we can get to come in here,” says historian Brenda Colladay, a longtime curator of the Opry’s collections who has helped to research a thorough 100th anniversary book.There was no such genre as country music when the show launched, just regionally specific versions of old-time music, dance tunes and folk songs. Over time, the sheer variety of performers featured in Opry lineups helped forge a cohesive identity out of those disparate styles, fundamentally shaping how we understand country.Alongside light classical fare were acts such as Uncle Dave Macon, a banjo-playing vaudevillian, and DeFord Bailey, a young Black harmonica wizard whose family string band had long played area dances. The Opry was essentially a barn dance on the radio, an already popular concept – they poached their master of ceremonies George D Hay from a rival show in Chicago.But the Opry initially faced local opposition from upper-class residents who fancied Nashville “the Athens of the South”, complete with a replica of the Parthenon, then under construction. “It made some people ashamed that [Nashville was] associated with hillbilly music,” Colladay says, including Tennessee governor Prentice Cooper who declined an invitation to attend an Opry celebration: “He felt like it was really hurting Nashville’s reputation.” Cooper was vastly outnumbered by the listeners who heard themselves in the show. As it went nationwide, it developed a massive, devoted following among rural and small-town listeners, as well as southerners who had migrated to industrialised cities. It got so popular that National Life and Accident executives got annoyed with rowdy fans clamouring to watch the live broadcasts at the company offices, and the Opry eventually moved to Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium in 1943.By then, it was no longer free to get in, and WSM had established an in-house booking agency that sent performers on the road. Staff and stars saw opportunities to capitalise on the show’s dominance in other ways, starting a recording studio, music publishing houses and enough other businesses to entice New York-based record labels to set up local operations. The presence of the Opry ensured that Nashville became home to the emerging, professionalised country music industry.It was where the thrillingly hard-driving new style of bluegrass was fleshed out, and where honky-tonk singers and folk-friendly troubadours alike found a home, but the show was sometimes too cautious to embrace trends. Take Elvis Presley: when he wasn’t invited back after his first Opry appearance, he moved on to a rival show in Louisiana. Stuart says the Opry might occasionally overcorrect, and points to its early-80s focus on the slick “urban cowboy” movement: “From time to time, I would tune in to the Opry, and when they introduced somebody, I kind of knew what song they were about to sing and what joke they were going to tell. It was a little weary.”Splashy additions like the Opryland theme park and regularly televised broadcasts on the Nashville Network brought in new listeners, as did the 2010s TV drama Nashville, set in the city’s country songwriting scene. But because the Opry was home to many generations of performers at once, there were times when some of the dedicated members felt they were denied opportunities to appear – Stonewall Jackson brought an age discrimination lawsuit, which was settled with undisclosed terms. And of more than 230 acts granted membership over the years only two Black country stars, the late Charley Pride and Darius Rucker, have been inducted since Bailey – and Bailey was fired during a copyright-related dispute in 1941, an injustice the Opry recently apologised for.But Rogers reports that for the last few years a double digit percentage of Opry’s performers have been artists of colour, making it much more diverse than contemporary country radio; according to leading researcher Dr Jada Watson, radio devoted less than 3% of its spins to artists of colour in 2024, despite Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter coming out that year. Rogers’ team began tracking performer demographics internally a few years back, “because it is right for this community and right for this show”.Equal Access, a DEI programme that helps businesspeople and music-makers of underrepresented identities navigate the country music industry, has forged a friendly relationship with the Opry. Programme manager Chantrel Reynolds says she and her colleagues made sure it was a safe space for discussing the Opry’s complex history with race before they began arranging visits with Opry leadership, and she finds that acknowledgment refreshingly “different from a lot of spaces” in country music. The Opry, she says, is “actively trying to programme these things, not just in Black History Month, but all year round”.With the help of Equal Access, contemporary country artist Angie K got her first chance to play the Opry last year. “I was the first person from El Salvador to play that stage,” she says. “I needed to be not just good – I have to be great, so great that they think, ‘We need to do this again with another Latin artist.’” She had scoured Opry history for predecessors who are queer and Hispanic like she is. “I’m very aware that there’s not many. What I love about the Opry is there’s still room to grow – they’re making a very intentional effort to change.”On the show, she sang originals addressing women as romantic interests, and she was “very grateful that a lot of people came up and said, ‘I’m so happy that you said those pronouns.’” For his part, Stuart marvels at how the Opry always finds its way back to varied vitality after weathering all manner of growing pains: “The thing that the history books tell me is that every institution goes through that from time to time”.The Opry expects decorum: there’s no alcohol backstage, just tea and lemonade, and in keeping with Federal Communications Commission rules, no cursing on stage. But Rogers sometimes dispenses reassurance to first-time performers who assume they should be at their most traditionalist. “That crowd out there is really full of all kinds of people, all walks of life,” he tells them. “Bring what you do to this stage. We wouldn’t have invited you to be on this stage if we weren’t up for what you bring.” Grand Ole Opry: Live in London is at Royal Albert Hall, London, Friday 26 September"
