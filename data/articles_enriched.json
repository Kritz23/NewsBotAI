I’m 21 and in the passenger seat of a friend’s old Daewoo, taking turns to drive it up to Byron for that year’s Falls Festival.It’s a stinking hot afternoon. The windows are down. We are approaching turn-offs for Forster and holding mild concerns about how our Korean chariot will handle the rest of the long trip. Its tiny back seat is packed to the brim – bags, tents, and another friend stuffed in among them. We should have left earlier, we say. Tired and sweaty, morale is sliding.Then, we hear the violins.Pop duo The Veronicas’ ranked third in yesterday’s Hottest 100 Australian Songs countdown.When Untouched by The Veronicas ranked third in the Hottest 100 Australian Songs Countdown, ahead of more obviously “Aussie” classics like Beds are Burning, You’re the Voice or Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again, it took some by surprise.But, as someone who has scream-sung every word – including the harmonies – to the 2007 song while driving up the highway to a music festival, the placing could not have made more sense.After reaching number two on the ARIA chart as the first single off their second album, Untouched has emerged as Brisbane-raised duo Jess and Lisa Origliasso’s most enduring track.LoadingThe song is loved by the LGBTQ community, particularly as Jess identifies as queer. As Triple J has reported, the sisters introduced Untouched as “the national gay anthem” to a crowd of expats at Los Angeles Pride in 2019.And, on any weekend across the country, Untouched will bring the girls to a wedding dance floor. Making it through the song’s four minutes and 14 seconds is an endurance event: memory, stamina and diction are all required to keep singing the right – “or wrong, or wrong or right” – repetitious words at 177 beats per minute.",

The song's popularity endures, with fans like the author of the article who has sung along to it on road trips to music festivals.",

But one week before their ninth album – drumroll for the most anticipated local release of the year – that Hottest 100 Australian Songs result felt pretty good to the Hilltop Hoods.“It’s a little bit surreal to be up there with some of the songs that shaped my childhood, artists that I consider the biggest things ever,” says Dan Smith, aka Pressure, who began rhyming and recording with school friend Matt Lambert (Suffa) in the early ’90s.

Expectations are high.LoadingSo what’s it like?Older. Not as in tired – though Rage Against the Fatigue is a brilliant snapshot of socially induced insomnia – but in the emotionally literate sense. It’s the sound of three guys deep into their 40s negotiating fame, grief, gratitude, depression, family, home and the road, with their usual linguistic precision and a more refined toolkit.“I like to think it’s one of our most honest records,” says Pressure. “Hip-hop is so literal. We’ve matured in our songwriting and just as human beings as well. We’re very comfortable in our own skin. I think that’s one of the things that’s helped us connect to our listeners over the years.”",

The four musicians will each be paired with an industry professional who will teach them the business – which ACP says is rife with “gatekeeping” – and support them as they produce singles, film their own documentary narrative and perform live.The opportunity to be connected with someone embedded in the industry is invaluable for ACP, whose local area of Ashwood lacks the infrastructure – such as studio recording spaces – and open networks to help thrust young, talented people into the big leagues.“The music industry can be a beautiful wreck sometimes,” he says. “Getting yourself and your music out there, it’s a beautiful cycle. But it can also be delayed by people who don’t want to help others.”Martha Kulang, who goes by Martha, experienced this first-hand when beginning her music career. The 25-year-old Narre Warren local – who traverses several genres such as Afro R&B, dancehall and rap – says a lack of networks and resources dampen an artist’s confidence.",

And you ask questions that you never used to ask, and that people would have been afraid to answer because they’d have thought, I’ll lose my job.

However, as soon as he noticed the blood seeping out of the fanged mammal, he realised it was a dead, but very real, bat.Speaking in the 2020 documentary The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, he recalled thinking it was fake when it was thrown towards him.Loading“I picked it up, put it in my mouth, crunched down, bit into it, being the clown that I am,” he said. “I had to go to the hospital afterward and get rabies shots, one in each rear.”It was later revealed that Mark Neal, an Osbourne fan who had been at the Des Moines concert that night, had allegedly thrown the animal on stage. According to an Iowa-based report, Neal said the bat was already dead before the show. However, Osbourne later said he felt the bat’s head “twitch” in his mouth.Osbourne had already earned the “Prince of Darkness” moniker during his time as the lead vocalist for Black Sabbath, but the bat incident certainly cemented his anarchic, unpredictable brand, and launched him into mainstream fame.He went on to appear on popular talk shows such as The David Letterman Show to explain why he bit the animal, and even sold plush toy bats with detachable heads as merchandise. From there, Osbourne continued to leverage his more mainstream stardom, but it arguably reached a peak in 2002 when he and his family launched The Osbournes, one of MTV’s first reality television shows. Its first season was cited as the most-viewed series ever on MTV, attracting as many as 8 million viewers in one airing.",

Understandably, her confidence was high. “I knew my way around a DAW [digital audio workstation], so I was like, ‘I can do this, this is what I’m good at!’” she recalls. “So I made this cool thing using presets and I handed it in like, ‘I killed that, no one’s gonna have anything as good as that.’” It did not go well. “I got back this really shit mark! The feedback was that I had used a violin preset and a violin can’t physically play what I put in. I was like, ‘Oh OK, I see that we’re not on the same page here.’” As origin stories go, it couldn’t be more precise: the electronic artist set on her path after challenging the possibilities of traditional music. “That’s the thing, I didn’t even care,” the 25-year-old DJ and producer says. “They had wanted us to compose for a real instrument, but I was on a different wavelength already.” Ninajirachi, real name Nina Wilson, is posing in between claw machines at games arcade Koko, looking at home in its futuristic Blade Runner glow. Her blunt red fringe pokes from under her black hoodie, which she removes to reveal an oversized shirt with the slogan “I wanna f--- my computer”, a provocative rendering of the title – and thematic drive – of her new album, I Love My Computer. “That was a voice memo I had from early 2024,” Wilson says, laughing. “I had just finished making something that sounded really good, and I was thinking about those memes that are like, ‘Listening to music isn’t enough, I need to f--- the song.’” Coming almost a decade after her first single as Ninajirachi (her moniker is a portmanteau of her first name and Jirachi, her favourite Pokemon, a plush version of which hangs from her handbag), and having built a reputation as one of Australia’s most esteemed and idiosyncratic electronic artists, the album is somehow Wilson’s debut full-length. “I guess I just didn’t feel like it until now,” she says. “Maybe it would have been good for my career to put out an album five years ago, but I just didn’t have the vision or the idea for it until now.” Across its 12 noisy and affecting tracks, Wilson charts a life entwined with computers and the internet and the way “computer music” cracked her world open. On the bouncy highlight iPod Touch, she sings about her teenage years growing up in the Central Coast’s beachside Kincumber, and the fantasy world she conjured catching the 64 bus to school and back, her headphones blaring the warped sounds of Rustie and Yung Lean, artists she was discovering on SoundCloud. Like an evocative haiku (“It sounds like iPod Touch, yellow Pikachu case/FL Studio free download in my search history/Hidden underneath my pillow ’cause I should be asleep,” she sings), iPod Touch also outlines Wilson’s online and musical initiation. She was watching a YouTube tutorial on how to tie-dye denim shorts when the song playing in the video’s background undid her. It was, as she later found out, French DJ Madeon’s viral Pop Culture (Live Mashup). “I was like, ‘Oh my god, what is this?’” Wilson recalls. “I had never heard anything like it. It felt like someone had given me crack. I just wanted to know how it was made.” “Maybe it would have been good for my career to put out an album five years ago, but I just didn’t have the vision or the idea for it until now,” says Ninajirachi.Credit: Steven Siewert Growing up on the Central Coast, loving dance music wasn’t a normal teenage phase. “It was mostly skater music, beach music – that was what most of my friends were into. They didn’t really like what I was listening to; they thought I’d gone down the rabbit hole,” she says, with a laugh. Even so, Wilson says she felt primed for a career in electronic music. Her mum, who worked primarily in homoeopathy and remedial massage when Wilson was growing up, and her dad, a tradie, were ex-ravers. Mum, who lived in London in the ’90s, even frequented Ministry of Sound and stockpiled the label’s CDs. By the time Wilson finished high school, she’d already been named a finalist in triple j’s Unearthed High and was booking gigs; her parents were instantly supportive. “Neither of them went to uni so they were like, ‘As long as you are making your own money and working hard, we don’t care, go give it a go,’” says Wilson. Since she was 17 and still underage, they’d chaperone her to gigs that generally started after 11pm. “One time I had a gig and my dad came in his pyjamas and flip-flops, and he got asked to leave the venue because he didn’t have the right clothes or shoes,” Wilson says. “I felt like an undercover agent, like no one knows I’m underage and my dad’s not even in the venue. I loved it, it felt like a very dangerous lifestyle.” It’s an odd thing to attempt to describe Ninajirachi’s otherworldly sound; you find yourself turning to nonsense like “scree”, “scronk”, “grunch” and “glang” to try to convey her off-kilter sonic madness. The drums on CSIRAC, for example – a track named for the first computer to ever play music, now housed at Scienceworks in Melbourne – recall pots and pans tumbling around a washing machine. Closer All at Once is glitched-out subterranean techno filled with cartoon boings, clatters and laser bursts, an intricate symphony of noise. “I love novelty and surprise, and I’m just always trying to get as close to that feeling of when I first heard stuff like that,” she says. “I’m never trying to reinvent the wheel because that’s just a crazy goal to have. I just want to make something that impresses me or makes me happy.” After segueing from simple loops on GarageBand as a kid, Wilson’s early releases, including her first EP, 2019’s Lapland, were made using FL Studio, before she switched to Ableton. “A lot of it is, like, re-sampling,” Wilson explains of her process. “If I synthesise something and then re-record it to audio and then do something to that and re-record it to audio again, it becomes this big, long recording of rubbish that I’ll then sift through. And then it’s like patchwork or collage, getting all the prettiest scraps and putting them together.” All I Am, a whirring trance track built around an MGMT-style chant, was born from an impromptu jam session at Ben Lee’s Los Angeles home, with Lee and Alex Greenwald from Phantom Planet. “Ben is so kind and generous, and he really supports Australian musicians that come to America,” Wilson says. “We all microdosed mushrooms and had such a fun, silly day. The idea was I was at the computer and I was the scribe and they would all just bash on different instruments around Ben’s studio and I’d record it and try to turn it into something ... I started playing it at shows and it went off, so I messaged them in the group chat, like, ‘Can I release this?’, and they were like, ‘Oh my god, go for it’.” By I Love My Computer’s second half, technological bliss makes way for dark-web brain-rot. On Infohazard, Wilson’s back on her school bus, but now she’s being exposed to snuff films and body horror. “I was so horrified, I couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks, just beheading videos and stuff,” says Wilson, recalling the things older boys with 4chan proclivities would share on the way to school. “It was a huge loss of innocence moment. It made me think of, if I’d never had the internet, or if I’d been this age even 100 years ago, maybe I would never even know about these things?” Perhaps most impressively, I Love My Computer showcases Wilson’s range, pivoting from the Dare-style indie sleaze of London Song to the sweet PC Music-influenced propulsion of Delete. “There’s this quote from Lorde that I love so much I have it screenshotted on my desktop and I always think about it – it was in a mailing list email she wrote on the 10-year anniversary of Pure Heroine,” Wilson says. “It’s about how every person is sitting on a gold mine that no one can rob because everyone’s unique makeup gives them their own perspective. I feel like, as long as I just do what I like, I can trust that my upbringing, experiences, physiology, taste will combine in a way that makes it all feel like me.” Like every Ninajirachi release since 2018, I Love My Computer comes via NLV Records, the label imprint of Sydney DJ Nina Las Vegas. Having a female mentor to guide her through such a male-dominated industry has been a privilege, Wilson says. “You’re just so naive when you’re young, and you don’t know what you don’t know, and also I don’t come from a music family or a white-collar family, so I didn’t know anything about business industry stuff. If I hadn’t met Nina when I was so young, maybe I would have ended up in other hands who didn’t care so much.” More recently, Wilson herself has stepped in as mentor and unifier. In 2022, as part of Vivid, she launched Dark Crystal, a club night celebrating underground dance culture. Inspired by overseas parties like Subculture and Heaven (where she once saw her idol, the late electronic artist Sophie, perform), the event proved so popular that this August she’ll host its fourth annual instalment. If privately tinkering in the laptop glow is her musical foundation, performing live is its own reward. “It’s pretty hectic a lot of the time, it’s not getting to bed til four or five in the morning and then getting a flight the next day, but I love it,” Wilson says. “I’m totally sober when I’m touring; I just have heaps of fruit and vitamin C powder, and it’s really chill. So even if it’s brutal, it’s fun. It’s all just memory-making.” Ninajirachi’s I Love My Computer is out on August 8. Dark Crystal 4.0 takes place at Melbourne’s Industrique on August 22 and Sydney’s Manning Bar on August 23. Copyright © 2025",

    "content": "On Friday afternoons, my husband and I have an “open house party” at our home. From 4pm, all our neighbours are welcome; no pressure, just an open invitation. We started the tradition after COVID-19 lockdowns, when we realised how many people our age – with young kids and no social life – were feeling isolated.It’s wonderful chaos: people are cooking dinner, there are kids asleep on the couch, and it can go on until 7pm and sometimes 2am. We’ve named our social group “Sippers” and we even have a logo for it: an illustration of a kid’s juice box next to a flagon of beer. Yes, there’s some drinking involved, but that’s not the drawcard. (I’m 15 years sober, so alcohol isn’t my incentive.)Our Friday night parties have become a place where barriers are broken down and bonds are formed, where the conversation veers between funny YouTube videos and a cancer diagnosis. The kids are there – always there – in the tapestry, either on the skate ramp in our garden, watching a movie or playing poker with the grown-ups. And it’s far from an echo chamber. The guest list is our street, so it’s not curated by backgrounds or interests.For those of us from more conservative backgrounds, throwing a party may not come as naturally.Credit: Getty ImagesDuring a debate about medical misinformation, my friend, a nurse, observed, “If I’d met you anywhere but here, I’d have so many preconceptions about you – and I’d have been wrong about all of them.”Our friendship wasn’t instant. It happened over time because we gathered, and gathered, and gathered again – with the type of social determination most of us lose after high school.For my husband, our open-door policy comes naturally; he comes from a family of “celebrators” who embrace the Aussie culture of barbecues and intergenerational beach hangs. For me, as a millennial with social anxiety raised in the closed-door culture of middle-class England, this type of “togetherness” has terrified me at times – but it’s also been a revelation.The spirit of hospitality extends beyond the party. Whether you need a babysitter or someone to lift something heavy, or there’s a real emergency, our guest list will always come running. In many ways, our open-door policy has improved my mental health more than therapy and years of meditation. It’s given me a sense of purpose and belonging and softened my self-consciousness. I used to curate the Post-It notes on my fridge before people came over. Now, I leave the reminders to “take UTI medication”. The same with our messy bathroom.Research shows that parties offering food, drink and a chance to celebrate – even small wins – are linked to longer lifespans, lower anxiety and depression, and better sleep and heart health. Yet, it’s easy to let socialising slip down – or off – our to-do list. For many of us, the party is over, and we don’t even realise what we’re missing.New data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found Americans are spending less time “socialising and communicating” than 10 years ago. For individuals, an average weekday in 2024 included just 26 minutes of “face-to-face social communication, or hosting or attending social functions”. On the weekend, that rose to 56 minutes. This was trumped by watching television and housework.",

At least that’s what Friendship, the black comedy starring Paul Rudd and Tim Robinson, suggests.In the film, Craig (Robinson), is a slightly awkward suburban dad who meets his neighbour, Austin (Rudd). At first, the friendship flourishes – Austin even invites Craig to a gathering with his other male friends. But Craig becomes increasingly over-invested in the friendship, pushing further and further until the relationship completely fractures.Building new male friendships isn’t always a walk in the park. Just ask Tim Robinson (left).Credit: Fifth SeasonDirected by Andrew DeYoung, the storyline is extreme, but it still explores a question many men have likely pondered at some point: Why is it so challenging to make friends with other men?It largely depends on how they’ve been raised, says Integrated Way relationship counselling specialist Daniel Lichtman. Many, particularly those in western cultures, are taught early on to be more emotionally contained and task-oriented rather than relationship-oriented.“Many men don’t necessarily seek out a relationship for the sake of having a relationship,” he says. “When men are struggling, they’re less likely to reach out to a friend for connection because they often feel more shame and embarrassment in vulnerability than women.”Tim Robinson isn’t the only one who struggles to make new friends. It turns out it’s a growing problem among men.Instead, many opt for “going at it alone”, Lichtman says. It’s a pattern of behaviour that appears to be getting worse. In 1990, 55 per cent of men told the Survey Centre on American Life that they had at least six close friends, but in 2021, that dropped to 27 per cent. Meanwhile, one in seven men say they have no close friends. Popular Australian men’s forums suggest a similar trend locally.This isn’t for a lack of opportunity. There are ample avenues for men to make new friends, says Lichtman, such as sports clubs and men’s walking groups. Admission numbers also indicate plenty are actively taking part.However, men often still lack the deeper friendships that women frequently foster within social groups.",

Add to this the doubts over the health benefits of some oils when they are heated, such as extra virgin olive oil, and you may be tempted to stick to lard.In fact, the ideal choice may be one of the most common oils used for cooking in Australia. In its “virgin” form, it contains healthy organic compounds called polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants. And while these are removed to create oil for cooking, the refined version many of us use still has health benefits.With seemingly endless varieties of cooking oils, it’s hard to know where to turn in the oil aisle. But sunflower oil can have its benefits.Credit: iStockWhat is sunflower oil?Sunflower oil is an unsaturated fat that is mainly sold in two forms, refined and virgin. Both are sources of vitamins E and K. Vitamin E helps maintain the immune system, healthy skin and eyes, while vitamin K helps blood to clot properly.In addition to polyphenols, the virgin version contains lecithin, a nutrient similar to the B vitamins, and carotenoids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. The more the oil is refined, however, the more these compounds are removed. One study found that heavily refined sunflower oil lost almost all of its carotenoid content.Many of the extra nutritional benefits of virgin sunflower oil are also lost when it is heated beyond a point known as the “smoke point”. This is where the fats and compounds in the oil change and start to break down. For this reason, in order to gain the maximum nutritional punch from virgin sunflower oil, it is best used as drizzle and in dressings.All types of sunflower oil contain omega-6, a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) that the body cannot make itself. It plays an important role in brain function and helps stimulate skin and hair growth, maintain bone health, regulate metabolism and maintain the reproductive system.Sunflower oil also contains low levels of omega-3, which is important for the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system (the network of hormone-producing glands).",

The in-demand product, with velcro straps at the top of the head and nape, resembles a post-surgery mask, and has earned comparisons with Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs on social media.The latest product from Kim Kardashian’s underwear brand Skims targets the jawline.“We’ve been doing shapewear for a really long time, and now we’re going to offer amazing face shapewear, which is just such a necessity,” Kardashian said in an Instagram video. “You can see that it just snatches your chinny chin chin with the jaw, and it’s super comfortable to wear at night or just around the house.”The item is marketed on the company’s social media as “infused with collagen yarns for ultra-soft jaw support” and “a must-have addition to your nightly routine”. However, Sydney-based plastic surgeon Dr Mark Kohout suggests customers manage any expectations of waking up contoured and camera ready.“The facial shapewear is analogous to elastic waist trainers,” Kohout says. “The idea is that the elastic fabric supports your tissues and makes them less susceptible to sagging from the effects of gravity. The downside is that to have any appreciable effect, you would have to wear them around the clock for months or years.”“The garment does not change the structure of the skin, nor does it tighten the collagen or elastin fibres in your skin. This may make it of limited practicality and effectiveness.”For more lasting results, Kohout suggests researching radiofrequency, energy-based treatments.",

He might have said “human”. Anyway, I got no closer to becoming a he-man than I did to becoming emperor of China. This failure has rankled. And I blame him.Lately, gyms have emigrated from shopping centres and high streets to light industrial zones alongside car wreckers, chemical storage facilities and bikie HQs. You see muscled fellows wearing wisp singlets plodding along the backstreets like the strongest, simplest superhero in any franchise – the Hulk, the Thing – the type of erratic champion needing close and constant instruction from the mastermind of the gang lest he accidentally break North America.Credit: Robin CowcherA whiff of the underworld accompanies bodybuilding for me. Is it the thuggishness muscle implies? The fact it can be turned so readily to standover work? Or the fact bikies and crime bosses have recently got so massive? Watching a cop trying to cuff a Coffin Cheater these days is like watching a toddler attempt a Rubik’s Cube.Maybe muscle gym membership should come with an ankle tracker. One of those devices parolees wear so they can’t slip down to the pub on Tuesday arvo, slurp daytime beers and slide back into the life. You want the Gold Class membership that comes with caramel flavoured “protein shakes”? OK, put this anklet on and surrender your passport.On the street I smile at bodybuilders for the same reason I smile at pastors, nuns, Hare Krishnas and Goths – just to be nice, to affirm they have a right to belief, or cosplay, or some mix of the two. It seems mean not to, like shouting “rhubarb” in a theatre.The most frightening car crash I was ever in involved a driver from a family of famous hotheads. It was early morning, and I was a sleep-addled passenger when this fool, hollering along with one of Joe Strummer’s insurrectionist ditties, went off the road and down an embankment, rolling his Renault a couple of times. I was thrashed by a maelstrom of his bric-a-brac: mixtapes, Coke cans, cigarette lighters, footy boots, an oboe, a ping pong paddle… When the death throes of the T14 finally silenced, the driver was lying on top of me in a blizzard of Wonderbra flyers he’d been paid to box-drop but hadn’t. “These bras seem reasonably priced,” I said. “Now get off me.” We climbed up and opened the driver’s door like submariners emerging from the deep, from a mission, from a war … into a day of peace, a day we didn’t deserve.LoadingAnd this is where my prejudice against muscle hounds really took flight. We had crashed outside a gym, an outer-suburban tilt-slab bunker veneered with dark glass. On hearing the roar of the crash a dozen or so simulacrum Schwarzeneggers strode outside and began circumnavigating the wreck asking fatheaded questions and pocketing Wonderbra flyers. They were a welcome sight to us. These lads, these eager behemoths, would soon right our car. Except … they were not eager at all.It turns out extreme muscle is purely aesthetic, a type of beauty pageant, not to be mistaken as useful, not a tool that might be employed in any nine-to-five capacity. These Hercules types (as often stuck to mirrors as blowies to flypaper) are objets d’art, not beasts of burden. None will dig a hole for fear of the bulging disc and the proletarian ignominy involved. None will cart a hay bale unless applauded. None will climb a ladder, being so dangerously top-heavy.",

The biannual Paris couture shows never disappoint in terms of pushing the boundaries on both the fashion and beauty front. The cost of the outfits on show can reach the hundreds of thousands but, fear not, there is plenty to feast on from a beauty and hair perspective that’s easily achievable at home, especially for those willing to push the boat out a little.Hunter Schafer’s slicked-back bun highlighted her bold gilded jewellery at a recent Schiaparelli haute couture show.Credit: Getty ImagesSchiaparelli began July’s Haute Couture Week with creative director Daniel Roseberry revealing his new view for the house – heavily referencing the mid-20th century – with super-sleek hair pulled tightly back from the face and not a stray strand in sight, plus the occasional bun. It was also a popular look for front-row guests, including Joséphine Japy, Gessica Kayane and Hunter Schafer, whose slick bun showed off her gilded-flower choker.To get this look, try a good-quality hair gel such as Crown Affair’s The Finishing Gel ($73) and a good boar-bristle brush, like Drybar Flat Mate Boar Bristle Brush ($138) to tame every hair into submission.The simplicity of the hair at Schiaparelli was a perfect foil to the intensity of the make-up: black and red lips and dewy skin, created by make-up supremo Pat McGrath. To achieve the pairing of “luminous skin” with “bold, powerful lips”, McGrath says she used her own brand’s PermaGel Eye Pencil in Xtreme Black ($50) and Legendary Lip Liner in Elson ($50).At Georges Hobeika, there was a slightly devilish, goat-like twist to the hair, with locks that were parted down the middle and styled into prominent “horns” on each side. You would need an armoury of hairspray and a stylist to even attempt this creation. For a quirky-but-earthly interpretation, try high bunches, curl them back on themselves, and secure with bobby pins.LoadingMeanwhile at Chanel, models sported sleek twisted ponytails with a few stray tendrils to soften the intensity of the severely scraped-back hair; this was the perfect backdrop for the glossy glass skin that was everywhere on the runways. Complementing the hair was a bronze smoky eye – achieve a similar look at home using Chanel Ombré Premiere Laque Longwear Liquid Eyeshadow in Desert ($57).Front-row inspiration was strong at Chanel, thanks to Naomi Campbell’s teased, twisted and elevated up-do, which was a show-stopper in itself and styled by the Chanel show hairstylist, Guido Palau.Eighties inspiration is ubiquitous this season, and a standout at the Imane Ayissi show, where models wore slicked-back, retro-inspired hair paired with pastel eyeshadow lined heavily in black, and brilliant red lipstick completely flaunting all the beauty rules by playing up eyes and lips all at once. But when it comes to couture, rules are made to be broken.",

And if you’re a parent of young kids, you need all the soul-balm you can get.But eating out when you have small children can involve a level of fortitude that can feel like more effort than it’s worth. In such situations, it’s hard not to be tempted to resort to the one tool we are told over and over again not to use: screen time.We all know what the recommendations on screen time are for kids: minimal is best, none is better, and they should definitely be avoided around meals. That’s because mealtimes are “an opportunity for communication”, says Dr Kimberley O’Brien, an educational and developmental psychologist. Plus, “if you’re distracting young people from meals, then they’re not really understanding things like nutrition, different textures, and balanced meals”.For most, dining out is not an everyday occurrence – so, surely, a little screen time is OK, right?

She says when she wants to go to a cafe or restaurant, rather than dining in, she tends to get takeaway and sit outside.“It’s much more enjoyable for me, and I don’t have to worry if the kids are noisy or up and down from their seats.”Her friend, Susannah McCaughan, a mum of two kids aged three and 18 months (with another on the way), says she and her husband are not ready to wave the white flag yet when it comes to eating out with their kids.",

The turtleneck has escaped its style sentence as the trusty uniform for women of a certain age who imagine that they’re Diane Keaton in a romantic comedy and computer nerds following in the white sneaker steps of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Also known as the skivvy or polo neck, the turtleneck received a get-out-of-fashion-jail-free card at the Celine runway presentation in Paris during the most recent haute couture season. Extravagant gowns encrusted with pearls or diamonds usually steal the haute couture show, but the debut of American designer Michael Rider at the French fashion house placed humble white turtlenecks front and centre. Uniqlo cashmere turtleneck (worn throughout), $130. Max Mara sleeveless coat, $4285, belt, $640, and pants, $1610. Weekend Max Mara x Sebago loafers, $915.Credit: Bec Parsons Rider may have been inspired by former Celine designer and turtleneck devotee Phoebe Philo but his runway masterclass restored the wardrobe staple of Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe to its former free-spirited glory. Here’s how to style a turtleneck and keep your cool while staying warm. The easiest way to embrace the turtleneck is to wear it with jeans or trousers as an alternative to bulky jumpers. Remember to balance out the snug fit of a thin turtleneck with straight-leg or wide pants or jeans. Marilyn Monroe wore her black turtleneck with checked capri pants and Audrey Hepburn with black tights, playing a beatnik in the classic musical Funny Face. Most of us are neither bombshells nor beatniks and more than 60 years have passed, so let’s loosen up. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Courtney Zheng “Elsje” dress, $600 (belt included).Credit: Bec Parsons One trend from the last millennium worth holding on to is feminist Gloria Steinem’s turtlenecks paired with long, statement silver necklaces from the 1970s. It’s not just groovy, it’s liberating. A turtleneck is a streamlined alternative to wearing a blouse beneath a blazer or jacket. When it comes to layering, the thinner the turtleneck the better. A white turtleneck breaking up double denim looks better than Jake Gyllenhaal breaking up fights in Road House. If you’re self-conscious about your curves, try wearing the turtleneck untucked to lengthen your silhouette. Otherwise, tuck it in and break out your best belt. Max Mara jacket, $2945. Deering “Gossamer” skirt, $280. Celine “Triomphe” sunglasses, POA.Credit: Bec Parsons If you’re after a monochrome approach, pairing a white turtleneck with a white jacket, or a black turtleneck with a black jacket, be prepared to play with textures. The cotton, wool or cashmere (if you’re fancy) of a turtleneck provides a delightful on-trend contrast with a crackly leather jacket or the sleek satin lapel of a dinner jacket. Sharon Stone’s black turtleneck worn beneath a black velvet jacket at the 1996 Academy Awards remains an inspiration to many stylists for a very good reason. The Parisian staple of a white turtleneck beneath a white collared shirt, worn with jeans and leather boots, is the height of trans-seasonal chic. Once again, make sure the turtleneck is fitted but let the shirt billow. Look for a shirt with a classic rather than tailored fit and remember, you can undo as many buttons as you like without having to worry about stiff breezes. Celine cashmere jacket, POA, silk blouse, POA, “Marco” jeans, $1700, and sneakers, $1350.Credit: Bec Parsons A black turtleneck with a white shirt and jeans also works but be careful of straying into the coastal grandma trend, exemplified by Diane Keaton, of white, on white, on white. If you take this path, be prepared for stares and stains. For the office, match your trousers with your turtleneck before layering with a white shirt. Grey and black work brilliantly, with white acting as a crisp contrast. Break out the starch because stiff cotton shirts work best with relaxed knits. Dresses with dramatic necklines, strong architectural details or summery fabrics can be given new life by wearing a turtleneck underneath. Contrasting sleeves emerging from short sleeves and fabric underneath plunging necklines can be visually exciting. It’s important to make the look intentional, letting the silhouettes speak up rather than throwing something together that looks like your laundry basket is overflowing. You don’t want to send the turtleneck back to fashion jail for another 20 years. Fashion editor: Penny McCarthy. Hair: Michael Brennan. Make-up: Chelsea Johnson. Styling assistant: Abbey Stockwell.

This week: in trouble with the manager for acknowledging hard work, working within a rigid appraisal system and signing a new contract without being able to read it first.You shouldn’t be reprimanded for giving a team member positive feedback.Credit: Dionne GainI am a mid-level manager and my boss accused me of not being tough enough on someone in my team because I complimented them during their performance review. My staff all work really hard and none of them need to be reprimanded or given negative feedback – I consider myself lucky to work with such professionals. I’m so disgusted with his comment; he is always so negative it’s depressing, and our organisation just accepts this. What do I do? Your boss sounds like a dinosaur. High-performing teams thrive on feeling trusted, motivated and appreciated. You should never need to defend giving positive feedback where it is due. That said, you always have to make sure you balance positive feedback with areas for development when needed. Many leaders can find giving tough feedback difficult, and while I am not suggesting that is the case here, always keeping things positive can be unhelpful too.In summary, don’t let your boss’s approach cause you to change your own leadership style. If you are finding your workplace culture stuck in the last century, it may be time to find a new company where you can work alongside others who share your modern leadership approach.Our company uses a performance rating system where “meets expectations” is the default, even for people who consistently do an exceptional job. “Above expectations” is rarely given, reserved for those going far beyond their role. This leaves high performers feeling deflated and unrecognised. I praise them, but they still ask, “Why only ‘meets’?” Pay and promotion aren’t directly tied to ratings, so why not give more “above” ratings to reflect strong performance and lift morale? The system feels demotivating and out of touch. How can I better support my team or influence change?LoadingIf the performance system HR has created is demotivating your best people, there is something seriously wrong with it. In theory, I understand why these kinds of formulaic, box-ticking ideas might be helpful. In practice, however, the unintended consequences can lead to a situation where people quickly work out what is needed to game the system altogether.Perhaps you and other managers in your position might like to get together and ask for the system to be reviewed. The first question I would be asking is: why do we use this? If it isn’t tied to pay and promotions, what is the real purpose? Once HR gives you that answer (which I assume will be something around guiding areas for individual development), you can explain the impact it is having on your high performers. It seems like this is a system designed to deal with average to underperforming team members, but the real impact is on the people who are doing an impressive job. The system should be designed around retaining them, not simply managing the few who are not doing so well.I work as a disability support worker, and my employer has said we’ll soon be receiving new employment contracts. They’ve mentioned changes to the sections covering hours of duty and ordinary hours, but claim it won’t affect our roles or standing in the company. They’re also outsourcing HR and want us to sign before we’ve seen the new contracts. I feel uneasy about the lack of transparency, even though they say they’re acting in good faith. If I choose not to sign the new contract, could they be required to offer redundancy?",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nA mid-level manager was reprimanded by her boss for giving positive feedback to a team member during a performance review, implying she wasn't \"tough enough\" on them.

    "content": "Were I to find myself held captive by alien anthropologists, keen to learn more about my generation, Generation X, I would tell them that we were so wry, cynical and intimidating during the 1990s – the peak of our cultural dominance – I didn’t even know I was one.Imbibing Douglas Coupland’s seminal novel, Generation X, reading The Face magazine and watching Richard Linklater’s 1991 cult classic, Slacker, the high priests and priestesses of Gen X seemed so far removed from my own droopy teen dagdom, the idea that I could count myself among their number was laughable. It was not until my mid-30s that the penny finally dropped.A still from the 1994 movie, Reality Bites, with Steve Zahn (Sammy), Winona Ryder (Leinana), Ethan Hawke (Troy) and Janeane Garofalo (Vickie). This may be the most inadvertently Gen X thing I’ve ever done: not bothering to learn what generation I’m a part of. That’s slack. If Gen X suffered from one malady, it was self-consciousness, with a secondary diagnosis of apathy. These are not useful traits to be holding onto in 2025, when the chaos enveloping the globe demands more than a shrug of the shoulders and contemptuously raised eyebrow.To pinpoint the moment when the rehabilitation of my jaded Gen X heart began, let’s rewind to June 2023. I’m surrounded by open browsers, but I’m not trying to prevent an unauthorised nuclear missile launch. It’s much more important than that: I’m trying to secure tickets to the Melbourne leg of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. The stakes are stratospheric. My oldest daughter is what you might call (if you were given to understatement) a Swiftie, but better understood as someone whose obsession warrants its own Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders entry. Her moods rise and fall based on Swift’s musical output; she confessed recently her low spirits were not the result of VCE pressures, but Swift’s extended break after her tour.Credit: Illustration: Dionne GainFloating on a sea of browsers, conscious of the maelstrom of emotions that will be unleashed should she miss out, I begin to understand that this is not just another domestic chore, like arranging dental appointments and parent-teacher interviews. To secure tickets, I must believe in the mission itself. I must buy into not only the Swift phenomena, but the unbridled enthusiasm of Gen Z. Could I become less Gen-X’y?This is no small undertaking: my Gen X snobbery is as much a part of me as the legs I walk on, and as reflexively deployed, a billowing smokestack of uppity disdain for mainstream culture that can be seen from outer space, like the Pyramids of Giza.There was no one less prepared than me to raise a Swiftie. A child who worships stadium-filling pop stars, rides the wave of each new viral trend without shame (her bedroom is currently filling with Labubu dolls), and doesn’t take sincere displays of emotion to be a measure of deep uncoolness; who doesn’t pretend not to care when really, she cares a lot. An earnest student of teen girldom, she manages her insecurities not by affecting an air of nonchalance, but by being the most fully actualised, CinemaScope version of a teenage girl she can be. Her music, her clothes and her make-up are not a studied rejection of mainstream aesthetics, as mine were, but a bear-hug of what she loves. Gen Z may carry many anxieties and burdens, but appearing unmoved by everything is not one of them.In my experience, ambivalence – about work, relationships, our very existence – was the sine qua non of Gen X. Don’t try too hard. Don’t let anyone know how much you want it – professional success, or love or money. Affect an air of affectlessness. Earnestness and sincerity were anathema. Our self-conscious ambivalence is perhaps best exemplified in a 1991 TV interview with Kim Gordon, of Sonic Youth. She has just produced a record, and the purpose of the interview is to talk about her experience of producing a record. “Is producing something you do a lot of?” the interviewer asks. “Oh yeah” replies Gordon, her voice dripping with sarcasm, eyes shaded by large black sunglasses. “I try to do it at least once a week.” She has the air of someone who’s been on the phone with Telstra all day, trying to fix a billing error. God forbid she should answer the question sincerely, or cop to enjoying what she does. This was the attitude I was marinated and cooked in.",

The other is in MLS, and that is believed to be his favoured option, but Sydney are still in with a shot.Sources with knowledge of negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Müller – a 13-time Bundesliga winner, two-time UEFA Champions League winner, and part of the Germany squad that won the 2014 World Cup – had been impressed with the pitch made to him by Sydney FC.Two of his former teammates are already at the club: Brazilian star Douglas Costa, who he played with between 2015 and 2017 at Bayern Munich, and the retired Alexander Baumjohann, Sydney’s head of player management who spent a year on the books at Germany’s biggest club and is believed to be spearheading the attempt to sign him.Thomas Müller lifts the World Cup in 2014.Credit: Getty ImagesHis recruitment would be an enormous boon for the financially stricken A-League and for Sydney FC, whose board has undergone an off-season restructure with the departure of long-time chairman Scott Barlow.

    "content": "We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. The NRL is on the verge of major change with the introduction of two teams in the next three years. A third team by as early as 2030 will take the competition to 20 teams. What will that look like? By Michael Chammas Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. The NRL has started sitting down with potential broadcast partners to open discussions about the future of the sport. With a team in Perth entering the competition in 2027 and a team in Papua New Guinea the following year, the NRL is just one team away from reaching its desired 20-team competition. That could come as early as 2030. This masthead has spoken to the key stakeholders in the sport to map out what a 20-team competition could look like, including the introduction of conferences and a change to the State of Origin period. There has been considerable debate in recent years about the NRL transitioning to a conference-based system, similar to those of several major American sports. In a 20-team competition, there are two viable options. One option is to split the competition into two 10-team conferences. What the conferences could look like.Credit: SMH That model, however, raises issues with the number of games played in a regular season. If teams played the other teams in their conference twice, and the other conference once, the competition would be extended from 24 to a 28-game season. That’s never happening. The model posed by this masthead is based on a four-conference system consisting of five teams in each conference. That allows teams to play each other once (19 rounds), then a rivalry month leading into the finals series, when teams square off against their conference opponents for the second leg of their home-and-away fixtures. The current draw sees some teams play opponents twice, with no formula or fairness behind the selections. The major scheduling talking points of a 20-team competition.Credit: SMH “Twenty teams is the right number,” ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys said. “It’s just a matter of when and how we can get there. We want to ensure the first two teams are successful. The Dolphins were successful. We want to make sure the Perth Bears and PNG are equally successful. That might bring the 20th team forward. The success of the two teams will determine how quickly we can move to a 20-team comp. “Conferences done correctly, yeah, absolutely, I like it. When I first started as chairman, I had a delegation of high-profile coaches and administrators. They wanted conferences, so I’ve always had it in the back of my head. Tribalism is the main ingredient in our sport.” With nine Sydney teams, it makes it difficult to place them into two clear conferences. By placing the “Big Six” Sydney teams in terms of fan bases and history (Roosters, Dragons, Rabbitohs, Bulldogs, Tigers and Eels) into two separate groups, you ensure more blockbuster games for broadcasters and fans. “It’ll be great for the gate,” Roosters chairman Nick Politis recently said. “Playing the Sydney teams twice is better for us than playing the Titans or Dolphins at home. Revenue will go through the roof. You’ll get better crowds. It’s fair. “We get back to playing a proper draw, not all over the place like it is now. That’s fairness. Now, the top clubs play each other twice, and the bottom teams play each other twice, and we end up somewhere in the middle and get a close comp. Everyone says we’re geniuses, but we’re not. It’s engineered.” Eastern conference: Sydney Roosters, South Sydney Rabbitohs, St George Illawarra Dragons, Cronulla Sharks and Manly Sea Eagles. Western conference: Parramatta Eels, Canterbury Bulldogs, Wests Tigers, Penrith Panthers and Perth Bears. This masthead placed the Perth Bears into a Sydney conference due to their North Sydney fan base. Placing them in another conference with teams like the Warriors, Cowboys or Papua New Guinea will only add to the extensive travel those teams will undertake. The 20th team has also been given to a second New Zealand team. “I wouldn’t want another team in New Zealand, I would want another southern Queensland team,” former Channel Nine boss David Gyngell said. “That would drive broadcast and Pay TV revenue for all parties. Ten games aren’t easy to schedule each week, but achievable. There are exciting times ahead for rugby league. Northern conference: Brisbane Broncos, Gold Coast Titans, North Queensland Cowboys, Dolphins and Papua New Guinea. Southern conference: Melbourne Storm, Canberra Raiders, Warriors, Newcastle Knights and a potential second NZ-based team. “Peter and Andrew have our complete support and confidence as they go into these broadcast negotiations,” South Sydney chief executive Blake Solly said. “We know they’re concentrating on the most compelling competition they can and getting full value for our broadcast rights. One of the great things about the conference system is the certainty it provides you year in, year out. The NRL could be in for huge changes.Credit: Getty/Michael Howard “Particularly the opportunity to build strong rivalries inside your conference. Anyone who has an interest in the NFL knows how passionate those rivalries can be in the conference and how much fans look forward to the fact they are taking place home and away every year.” While the teams in the southern conference would be required to travel further distances than the teams in the Sydney conferences, it is no more travel than they are currently being asked to undertake. “We would need convincing as an out-of-town club whether a conference system would be good or not,” Raiders chief executive Don Furner said in fear of the disadvantage of the additional travel. How a 10-game round television schedule may look.Credit: SMH Most would agree that the current NRL season, at 24 games with three byes, is too long. However, broadcasters pay top dollar for a product that provides commercial partners a substantial window of promotion. The same goes with the clubs, who would be significantly impacted by a draw that would only see teams play each other once (19 rounds). The Rugby League Players’ Association believes a 19-20 game regular season is an optimal amount to reduce the workload on players and minimise injuries. “The season schedule has desperately needed serious innovation for years, and we are and have always been up for that discussion,” RLPA chief executive Clint Newton said. “With a new broadcast deal approaching, we’ve got the best chance in a long time to stop patching problems and start building something progressive and transformative, but sustainable. “Fewer games per NRL club, a better-aligned Origin period, and a genuine international window. If we get those right, we can deliver the content broadcasters need, grow the game globally, and better protect players’ welfare and careers.” Clubs are mindful, however, that reducing the season to 19-20 games will impact their corporate revenue, sponsorship deals and the income from tickets and membership. “I understand the need to protect the players and the increasing demands of the game, but that would be a major change from where we are right now,” Eels chief executive Jim Sarantinos said. The proposed NRL calendar.Credit: SMH “Reducing the number of home games for each club from 12 to 9 would have a significant impact on how clubs engage with fans, members and sponsors, and the business model across the whole game would need to change.” There are currently 204 games in the NRL regular season. Even if the competition is reduced by one round, the NRL will increase the number of regular-season games to 230 (13 per cent increase) with the addition of two extra games per round with the new teams. “Personally, I’d like to see the season shorter,” Furner said. “It’s such a long season with rep football and trial matches. If there was a way to satisfy the broadcasters with less NRL games, that would be an ideal outcome. I look at the amount of games in the NFL, and it works for them.” Comparing the difference between the current season structure and what it would be like under the proposed 20-team, four-conference system.Credit: SMH It’s imperative to place a greater importance on conference rivalry games. Incentivising the conference champion will only add to the spectacle of some of the blockbuster matches. The reward for the highest-ranked team in each conference (based on the overall ladder) is a direct pathway into the finals series. Those teams would be seeded from 1-4 based on the best overall win/loss record throughout the season. That would guarantee the conference champion a second chance if they lose their opening game of the finals. Those teams, based on the current NRL ladder after 21 rounds, would be the Raiders, Bulldogs, Broncos and Sharks. The other six teams would be seeded from 5-10 in order of their overall standing on the combined ladder. In the first week of the finals, 7th would play 10th and 8th would play 9th for the right to progress into the final eight the following week. Teams 1-6 would be given the week off in the first week of the finals. This would help negate the current situation, which sees many teams resting their players in the final round of the regular season to prepare for the finals at the expense of the integrity of the competition. The 10-team finals series format based on the 2025 calendar.Credit: SMH The opening weekend of the finals would determine the two teams that would join the remaining six teams in week two of the finals. From that point, the current top eight finals system would be applied. It gives broadcasters an additional two sudden-death finals games to sell to commercial partners and provides the game with an uplift in attendance and television viewers. By reducing the regular season by one round and extending the finals series by one week, the NRL grand final will remain on the October long weekend. “I used to think the ideal model was to split the competition into two conferences and have your Sydney grand final and out-of-Sydney grand final, with the two teams playing in some sort of Super Bowl,” South Sydney coach Wayne Bennett said. “Once we get to 20 teams, there will be too many teams for that. Maybe the four conference system is the way to go because we need more rivalry games.” The television ratings speak to the beast that is State of Origin, but often the representative fixture comes at the detriment of the NRL competition. Clubs pay their premium players top dollar, only to lose some of them to State of Origin, often picking up injuries or returning both physically and mentally fatigued. Queensland celebrate winning this year’s State of Origin series.Credit: Getty Images “Currently, it’s the worst model we can have,” Bennett said. “It’s the timing of it and how it least impacts the clubs. One of the great fallacies of our game is that the best team doesn’t always win the grand final. Not every season, but Origin has impacted on the finals and the premiers. I laugh because I’ve coached all these years and with a high number of Origin players in my teams. “I’m qualified to tell you how much it takes a toll. I have no doubt we should have gone back-to-back premierships at the Dragons, but Origin killed us. When the players came back they were physically drained and mentally shot after a brutal series. We never recovered from that.” Wayne Bennett with players Jamie Soward and Dean Young at the Dragons after the 2010 grand final win.Credit: Getty State of Origin belongs in the middle of the season, but does it have to last so long? Does it have to have such a significant impact on the NRL teams? There are currently 53 days between when the players arrive in camp for game one and when they leave after game three. They do return to their clubs in between matches, but the NRL can’t continue to allow Origin to have such a major impact on clubs. “The Origin schedule is a bit like Frankenstein’s monster,” Solly said. “The NRL competition provides the ARLC with 90 per cent of its revenue, yet a three-game series disrupts it for almost 30 per cent of it. No other premier sporting club competition would accept that disruption. People at the NFL, the NBA, the Premier League think we clubs are mad in accepting that position. Payne Haas was on light duties leading into all three Origin games this year.Credit: Getty Images “The current Origin window is a complete disaster for clubs. It takes our best players away too often and for too long. We understand that this current system was a product of this TV cycle.” “We much preferred the Wednesday-Sunday-Wednesday schedule of the previous system, and we’ve been vocal in seeking change from the NRL. We respect that Andrew and Peter can’t do anything in this cycle, but everyone in the game wants a shorter Origin period with less disruption to the NRL competition.” How the State of Origin period would work, based on the 2025 calendar.Credit: SMH Under the model proposed, the Origin period would be reduced from 53 days to 29. Players would remain in camp for the duration of the series, playing the first game on a Wednesday, the second game 10 days later on a Sunday, and the third 10 days later on a Wednesday. “I would debate the duration of the State of Origin as that’s a critical component,” Gyngell said. The model proposed would see NRL clubs lose Origin players for just one game each. Split rounds and mid-week matches, similar to the English Premier League over the Christmas period, would give broadcasters an 18-day footy festival each May (combination of NRL games, men’s Origin, women’s Origin, under 19’s Origin and under 21 Test matches involving Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Samoa). “I think the system we have now is working,” NSWRL boss Dave Trodden said. “I think under any model that will be satisfactory for the broadcasters, there’ll be a consequence to the clubs. The most important consideration is going to be what the broadcasters think of the schedule. “State of Origin drives so much of the commercial value in the broadcast deal, so that will be in the minds of the decision makers. With the massive ratings they have been getting the last couple of years, broadcasters will be reluctant to mess around with the schedule too much.” The proposed changes would ensure Origin players remain in camp throughout the series, negating the risk of injuries suffered when returning to club land and continually building on the hype of the series without the stoppages that currently exist. “As long as the solution doesn’t compromise the quality of the product, because Origin is so big and so unique, it needs to be taken into account,” Queensland Rugby League boss Ben Ikin said. “But more importantly, as long as the rules that they change advantage Queensland and not NSW, we’ll be fine.” Like the Six Nations in European rugby union, there is an opportunity to build an annual competition that helps grow the international game. A Five Nations tournament involving England, Australia, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand would be played each year (non World Cup years) over five weeks, starting a fortnight after the grand final. The proposed Five Nations tournament.Credit: SMH The annual leave entitlements of the players would prohibit the competition running longer than five weeks (mid-November), therefore, the winner of the Five Nations would be determined by the ladder and not a final. “Because of the club’s success we’ve gone deep into the year, and that has been compounded by representative player selection,” Panthers rugby league chief executive Matt Cameron said. “Although we’re really proud of this success, it does put pressure on the preseason time frame and any future model that would help alleviate these pressures would certainly be a benefit to all clubs.” NRL is Live and Free on Channel 9 & 9Now Michael Chammas and Andrew “Joey” Johns dissect the upcoming NRL round, plus the latest footy news, results and analysis.  for the Sin Bin newsletter.

Subsequent investigations by the Canadian media found that their junior and senior national teams, for both men and women, had been using drones as far back as 2016 to spy on opposition training sessions in a bid to gain insights on tactics and personnel.Canada’s women were docked six points, hampering their bid to defend their Olympic title, and their coach Bev Priestman, one of her assistants and an analyst were all sent home.

Whoever actually came up with those famous words, be it Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Wayne Gretzky’s old man, Michael Scott from The Office ... they were onto something.Which brings us to Sydney FC’s ambitious pursuit of Thomas Müller. Ambitious might be an understatement.Thomas Müller and Harry Kane after one of Bayern Munich’s matches at the Club World Cup.Credit: APFirst revealed by this masthead, the Sky Blues have been in talks with the Bayern Munich legend’s management about coming to the A-League next season - and if they somehow manage to pull it off, it’d be one of the greatest coups in domestic soccer history.Even though they’ve been told they’re down to the final two - as German outlets have since reported, as well - it’s more unlikely than likely. Those in the know, plus a variety of overseas reports, say that Müller is probably bound for Major League Soccer, and the money he could earn there will trump whatever Sydney’s offer is many times over.Not to mention the post-career opportunities that the 35-year-old will be exposed to in a country that is about to co-host the World Cup, if he wants to go into the media once he hangs up his boots.But there’s still a chance. And however remote it is, the Sky Blues were right to explore the possibilities. As one of the A-League’s biggest clubs, it’s incumbent upon them to do so.Juan Mata and Douglas Costa.Credit: Getty ImagesTimes have changed since they landed Alessandro Del Piero more than a decade ago. Back then, it felt like the A-League was almost on par with MLS, in terms of being a late-career destination for global superstars; not anymore.Not even close, actually. Los Angeles FC, who have reportedly shown the strongest interest in Müller, are also attempting to sign Son Heung-min from Tottenham Hotspur. Such is their financial power, they could probably sign both. And then there’s the financial monster that is Saudi Arabia to contend with. It has never been more difficult for Australian clubs to compete for marquee imports.",

There’s nothing wrong in that. It’s the modern trend, people want to do their own things,” he said.Ananya Birla, 31, has her own interests that are independent of the sprawling commodities behemoth led by her father.Credit: Getty Images for Kaushik VelendraTwo hundred years ago, that “modern” trend among young people used to be enterprise. That’s when families like Piramal’s began to spread out of the Marwar region in land-locked northern India to take advantage of British-controlled trading opportunities in the port cities of Bombay and Calcutta – now Mumbai and Kolkata. Cotton, jute and opium sold to China provided the seed capital to the Marwari business community for everything from textile mills to cement factories.Radhika Piramal, a Harvard University MBA, was the chief executive officer of luggage giant VIP industries for a few years before quitting in 2017By the early 20th century, these emerging industrial empires were large enough to challenge the colonial masters and their commercial interests. The likes of Ghanshyam Das Birla openly supported Mahatma Gandhi’s campaign for independence, even as they outran rivals like Andrew Yule & Co. The Birla House in Delhi, a prominent hub for the freedom movement, was also where Gandhi was assassinated. As the sway of family firms continued after India’s 1947 independence, it was believed that newer generations would always be available to take over the reins.Below the surface, however, the link between ownership and management has been weakening for some time. Piramal’s daughter, Radhika, a Harvard University MBA, was the chief executive officer for a few years before quitting in 2017 and relocating with her spouse to London. Her same-sex marriage is not legally recognised in India. The luggage maker was back to being in the care of professional managers, a double-edged sword considering that a rival firm set up by a former managing director is now three-fifths bigger than VIP by market value.The heirs of prominent business families – Millennial and Gen Z billionaires – are setting their own life goals. It’s the sensible thing to do. In a labour-surplus economy, access to capital through clan networks and strategic marital alliances was family-run firms’ core advantage. But via public markets and private equity, finance is now available to a much wider section of entrepreneurs. Risk-taking has been democratised.That frees up younger members of business dynasties to try new things. Someone recently asked the singer-songwriter Ananya Birla on social media if she was from the family behind India’s largest-selling cement brand. She is indeed the great-great-granddaughter of Ghanshyam Das Birla. But from financial inclusion among rural women to a recently launched beauty brand, the 31-year-old Oxford graduate has her own interests that are independent of the sprawling commodities behemoth led by her father.",

The fact that it wasn’t up probably is another data point that reinforces it is open to the Reserve Bank to cut rates,” Miller said at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle event in Sydney.LoadingAt the same time, Miller still cautioned that the progress in dealing with inflationary challenges was “not overwhelming”, and he pointed out markets had been convinced there was a cut coming in July, only for the Reserve Bank to hold. He said the central bank remained focused on whether this was the right time to cut rates.“It feels like there’s even more evidence now that they should [cut rates], but I can’t help but think that only four weeks ago, everyone was absolutely clear that there was a rate cut coming, and it didn’t,” he said.“I think we’re lucky to have a Reserve Bank and a governor with that independence and that confidence to look after the country’s long-term interests.”",

    "content": "Of all the things that could affect Commonwealth Bank’s lofty share price, the construction of a massive hydroelectric dam in China is probably not top of mind.But when bank-watchers scour the world for explanations on why bank shares lagged last month, an enormous hydroelectric dam project in Tibet is one of several factors that do come up.The reason, according to analysts, is that big ASX investors are constantly tossing up whether to put their money into either of the market’s two massive sectors: banks or miners. Which way investors lean between these two sectors can have a big bearing on share prices: if investors prefer miners, the banks tend to lag, and vice versa.In market jargon, it’s referred to as “rotating” between the two sectors, and it can have a significant impact on share prices, especially for the most highly valued bank, CBA.It means the price of bank shares can be influenced by things that have little direct bearing on bank’s core business, but that matter a lot for miners, such as the strength of China’s construction sector, which affects commodity prices.A section of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, where China this month started building what’s intended to be the world’s largest hydroelectric dam.Credit: Getty ImagesSome argue that is what has happened in the past month or so, and the launch of an enormous dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet fed into that optimism on commodities.The underperformance of banks was a key trend in July. Except for ANZ Bank, the other Big Four lagged the ASX 200 index. CBA lost about 4 per cent in the month. Miners had the opposite experience: BHP gained close to 7 per cent in the month.This was a stark change from the dominant narrative of the past year, in which banks have sharply outperformed miners, much to the frustration of the investment pros who can’t fathom why the CBA share price has kept rising.Now, the CBA share price is more than 8 per cent below its record highs of June and the bank’s market value has slipped under the $300 billion milestone, though CBA shares are still up strongly since the start of the year.",

The woman at the centre of the Coldplay kiss cam scandal has resigned. Kristin Cabot, who was caught on the jumbotron canoodling with her boss Andy Byron at the UK band’s Boston concert last Wednesday, has stepped down as the HR chief at Astronomer, a job she held for less than a year. The New York-based tech company confirmed the news in a statement on Thursday, US time. “I can confirm that Kristin Cabot is no longer with Astronomer, she has resigned,” a spokesperson for the company told Page Six. It comes days after Byron also resigned from his job as the firm’s CEO. “As stated previously, Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” a rep for the tech company said on Saturday. “Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO.” After the pair infamously scrambled to hide from the concert kiss cam, and subsequently made headlines around the world, Astronomer announced it was launching a formal investigation into the scandal and placed Cabot and Byron on leave. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin was left bewildered by their actions on the big screen, joking onstage the pair were either “really shy or having an affair”, as details swiftly emerged about their respective marriages. Byron, who is estimated to have a net worth of $A76 million, is married to a woman named Megan Kerrigan Byron, who has since removed his last name from her Facebook and deactivated her social media accounts. She is yet to comment publicly. Cabot, for her part, appears to be married to Privateer Rum’s CEO Andrew Cabot, since they share the same last name and are co-owners of the same house in New Hampshire. She divorced her first husband, Kenneth Thornby, in 2022, according to Massachusetts court records. Neither Byron nor Cabot have commented on the affair allegations. Meanwhile, the fate of both their respective marriages remains unknown. Cabot was hired as the company’s human resources officer in November 2024, while Byron held the position of CEO from July 2023. He’s a social media sensation with more than 200 million views online, and now, the Tree of Wisdom has made a mega announcement.

    "content": "The Grammy winner took the stage at 2:30am at Essence Fest, performing to a near-empty stadium after hours of chaos. Justice for Lauryn Hill. The Grammy Award winner, 50, took the stage at the 2025 Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans over the weekend hours later than expected, forcing her to perform in front of a nearly-empty crowd at Caesars Superdome. Hill’s set was supposed to take place late Friday night as part of the rest of the line-up, which included GloRilla, the Isley Brothers, Babyface, Maxwell, Lucky Daye and Psiryn. However, the event ran late and most of the performers didn’t go onstage until at least an hour after they were scheduled to do so. In Hill’s case, she finally started her set at 2:30am on Saturday, just minutes after the festival announced there were “technical difficulties.” By that time, only several hundred people were in the stadium, which can accommodate over 80,000 people. Hill’s performance lasted about an hour and ended at around 3:37am, according to Nola.com. Despite the delay, Hill put on an electric performance for the crowd. She wore a blue polka dot full-length dress with a gele atop her head as she sang some of her classics including Ex-Factor from her critically acclaimed debut album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Hill even brought out her sons Zion Marley, 27, and YG Marley, 23, onstage to perform with her. After belting out a rendition of Killing Me Softly With His Song as a tribute to the late Roberta Flack, Hill took a request from the crowd for her final song of the night. She chose Fu-Gee-La, a song by her hip-hop group, the Fugees. Following the event, Essence Festival released a statement defending Hill over her delayed performance. “Family is family and around here we protect our own no matter what the PEOPLE have to say,” the festival wrote on Instagram Sunday. “Let’s be very clear — WE don’t play about Ms. Lauryn Hill. Not for clicks. Not for headlines.” “She arrived on schedule, stepped on that stage, and delivered the kind of performance only a legend can,” the statement continued. “The delay? Not hers. We will take that. The moment? One for the books. The legacy? Still unmatched.” “Put some respect on her name. Keep the takes, but keep her out of them,” the festival added. “All love and deep profound admiration for Ms. Lauryn Hill.” Hill’s devoted fans showed her support on social media as well. “If I’m Lauryn Hill, I’m probably cussing out Essence cause this is just unacceptable,” one fan wrote on X. “It’s very easy to get Lauryn Hill trending with false narratives. Let’s provide the facts. The entire festival was pushed back,” another fan said. “This was literally not her fault.” Someone else tweeted, “I think a few blogs and publications owe Ms. Lauryn Hill an apology. I know she’s had TERRIBLE time problems in the past, but that Essence Fest situation didn’t sound like it was on her. No need for them (or the event) to use her as a scapegoat.” Ironically, Hill has a history of being late for performances. She even addressed her constant tardiness during a delayed concert in Los Angeles in November 2023. “Yo, y’all lucky I make it on this blood ras stage every night,” Hill reportedly told the crowd at the time. “I don’t do it because they let me do it. I do it because I stand here in the name of God and I do it.” This article originally appeared in New York Post and has been republished with permission. To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "After his shock Triple J debut, Jimmy Barnes is marking Working Class Man's 40th birthday with an all-star line-up of 80s legends. Jimmy Barnes didn’t have Working Class Man landing on Triple J’s Hottest 100 on his list of ways to celebrate this year’s 40th anniversary of his signature anthem. “It’s really nice to actually get airplay on Triple J; it’s the first time in 40 years,” Barnes said laughing. Australia’s favourite rock star will see out the year with the Working Class Man 40th Anniversary Tour as the song clearly finds a younger audience, generating more than 70 million streams in recent years. With Australian music fans tripping on 80s rock and pop nostalgia, Barnes has enlisted Icehouse, his Cold Chisel bandmate Ian Moss and Kate Ceberano for the mini-festival shows later this year. The tour kicks off at Mount Duneed Estate in Geelong on November 22 and then heads to Sirromet Wines in Mount Cotton November 29, Bimbadgen, Hunter Valley on December 6, The Regatta Grounds, Hobart on January 17, Peter Lehmann Wines in the Barossa Valley on January 31 and Sandalford Wines in Swan Valley February 7. Barnes and Icehouse frontman Iva Davies go way, way back to the late 70s when Chisel and Flowers (who became Icehouse in 1981) were both signed to Dirty Pool. That independent booking agency completely disrupted the Australian music industry in favour of artists getting the primary share of ticket sales instead of agents and venues. “At the time Premier Artists had a stranglehold on the industry and then the managers of the two biggest band in the country, Cold Chisel and The Angels decided to break away and form their own agency,” Davies recalled. “And they were looking for a younger band, so the ‘apprentices’ they found was Flowers.” Barnes said Flowers became regular openers for Chisel shows as the synth band’s popularity grew off the back of singles Can’t Help Myself, We Can Get Together and Walls. The rocker said he even offered up his bedroom as a location for the video shoot for Walls. “Jane and I lived in this house just around the corner from Dirty Pool, and our bedroom was in a small ballroom, it was beautiful, and Iva came and filmed there,” Barnes recalled. “So we were mates and label buddies in Dirty Pool, fighting against the monopolies and toured a lot together. Iva was there when I met Jane in Canberra in 1979!” Working Class Man has long been regarded as Barnes’ signature song, the anthem to unite not only his audience in loud crowd karaoke at his shows, but instantly recognised from the opening line “Working hard to make a living.” But the truth is the song isn’t about Barnes. It was written by Journey keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 1985 after a conversation with the Aussie rocker about his fans. “He was really interested because he had heard they were wild audiences in Australia and I don’t think Journey had ever played here,” Barnes said. “I told him about my audience being hard working, doing nine-to-five in factories, and come Saturday night, kicking their heels up and going berserk. You could see him taking it all in. “About a week later, he rang up and said ‘I’ve written a song for you called Working Class Man.’ And my immediate gut reaction was, ‘Oh f …, he’s written a song about me called Working Class Man, how cliche is that?’ “And he said ‘It’s not about you, it is about your audience.’ When I heard the demo, it was just incredible. The minute I heard it, I knew that it was sort of a career-defining song.” Icehouse also proved wildly popular with the more than 2.6 million voters for the Hottest 100 Australian Songs countdown last weekend, with the evocative classic Great Southern Land peaking at No. 35. While these revered artists may have cut their teeth in Australia’s notorious beer barns in the 80s, now they get to play wineries. The first shot at tickets will be via the Telstra Plus Member presale on August 4 from 10am via telstra.com/music MG Live, Face To Face Touring, and Jimmy Barnes fan club presales open on August 6 ahead of the general sale from 2pm on August 7.

    "content": "UK singer Matty Healy appeared to make a dig at his high-profile ex Taylor Swift during his set at the Glastonbury festival. Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend Matty Healy appeared to drag the pop star while performing at the Glastonbury Festival in England. The 1975 frontman took a moment to address the crowd at Worthy Farm in Somerset on Friday night, saying, “What this moment is making me realise is that I probably am the best,” per a video posted on Variety’s X account. “I’m probably the best songwriter of my generation,” he continued while raising a glass of beer. “The best, what do we say — a poet — ladies and gentlemen, is what I am.” Healy, 36, indirectly appeared to be talking about Swift’s 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is believed to contain several brutal nods to the rocker. The star further bragged that he was a “generational wordsmith.” A fan in the background of the clip joked that Healy was hinting at the pop superstar’s album. Healy and Swift, 35, dated briefly for a month from May to June 2023, following the latter’s split from Joe Alwyn. During their short-lived romance, the duo were inseparable, with the crooner attending several of the Grammy winner’s sold-out Eras Tour concerts. They were also often spotted in New York City, including at the Electric Lady recording studio. Page Six also learned that Swift and Healy were caught packing on the PDA at Casa Cipriani while out with Jack Antonoff and Margaret Qualley. When the duo split, an insider told Entertainment Tonight that it was due to incompatibility and scheduling issues. When Swift released TTPD in April 2024, fans were surprised to discover much of the searing album was about her relationship with Healy as opposed to Alwyn, the latter of whom she was with for six years. It was rumoured that she wrote the album’s title track, Guilty As Sin, Down Bad, Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus, The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived and I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can) about Healy. A source told Us Weekly that Healy was “blindsided” by the album. Swift moved on with boyfriend Travis Kelce over the summer of 2024, and they’ve been going strong ever since. Healy, meanwhile, got engaged to model Gabbriette Bechtel in June 2024. This story originally appeared on New York Post and was reproduced with permission Michael Jackson's daughter Paris has ended her engagement to Justin Long, with the star making the revelation after being photographed in tears on a Malibu street.

    "content": "Justin Timberlake has released a lengthy public statement detailing his secret battle with a “debilitating” illness. Justin Timberlake has been diagnosed with “debilitating” Lyme disease. The singer made the health admission in a lengthy Instagram statement today while reflecting on his Forget Tomorrow tour, which wrapped in Turkey this week. “I’ve been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease -— which I don’t say so you feel bad for me –– but to shed some light on what I’ve been up against behind the scenes,” the 44-year-old told his followers. Timberlake noted that Lyme disease, which is a bacterial infection spread by ticks, “can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically.” MORE: Justin Timberlake surprise money move Being diagnosed helped the “shocked” Grammy winner understand “why [he] would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.” He continued, “I was faced with a personal decision. Stop touring? Or, keep going and figure it out.” The former *NSYNC member ultimately decided, “The joy that performing brings me far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling.” He is “so glad [he] kept going” to prove his “mental tenacity” and share “special moments” with fans. Timberlake acknowledged elsewhere in his caption that he chose to be “transparent about [his] struggles” so they would not be “misinterpreted.” The singer, notably, has been blasted for lacklustre performances since kicking off his tour in April 2024. In one viral video shared via TikTok last week, Timberlake strolled around the stage and engaged in occasional dance moves, rarely bringing the microphone to his mouth. “Go on girl, give us nothing,” one social media user wrote of the compilation. One fan complained, “I get that you have a lot of concerts and are touring the world, or whatever, but you cannot be singing less than a quarter of a song.” Additionally, Timberlake made headlines earlier this month when he was caught on camera screaming at crew members over an issue-riddled performance in England. The songwriter’s wife, Jessica Biel, showed her support for her partner by reposting his health news to her own Story. The couple have been married since 2012 and share two sons: Silas, 10, and Phineas, 5. This story originally appeared on Page Six and is republished here with permission.

    "content": "Police are investigating two UK bands following their controversial “free, free Palestine” chants at the Glastonbury Festival. Police have put UK bands Bob Vylan and Kneecap on notice following their controversial performances at the Glastonbury festival on Saturday. Avon and Somerset Police are examining video footage from the famed music festival to determine if criminal offences were committed when bands Bob Vylan and Kneecap took to the stage. The investigation was sparked after British punk duo Bob Vylan led festival-goers in chanting “free, free Palestine” and “death, death to the IDF” – referencing the Israel Defense Forces – to the packed-out crowd, many of whom were waving Palestinian flags. Irish rap trio Kneecap took to the West Holts Stage after Bob Vylan and followed suit, encouraging concertgoers to chant “free Palestine” during their set. While onstage, band member Naoise O Caireallain, who performs as Moglai Bap, also slammed UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as their fans waved banners and wore face paint to support the band. “The Prime Minister of your country, not mine, said he didn’t want us to play, so f**k Keir Starmer,” he told the crowd. The performance came just one after before JJ O Dochartaigh, aka DJ Próvaí, was seen wearing an anti-Israel campaign group ‘Palestine Action’ T-shirt in a social media post. The stage incidents have since prompted police to review video evidence from both performances to assess whether to proceed with criminal investigations. “We are aware of the comments made by acts on the West Holts Stage at Glastonbury Festival this afternoon,” Avon and Somerset Police tweeted on X. “Video evidence will be assessed by officers to determine whether any offences may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.” The performances have also drawn criticism from the UK government, with a spokesperson saying in a statement, “We strongly condemn the threatening comments made by Bob Vylan at Glastonbury.” Social media has also exploded with outrage over the bands’ controversial appearances, with US rapper Azealia Banks among the voices condemning the performances. “That is actually crazy. To allow an artist to incite a mob and shout death upon anyone at a major music festival is CRAZZZZYYYY,” she tweeted on X. “And like how does he think that’s going to accomplish anything? Wooooow the UK is losing its mind.” “There’s nothing worse than artists who lose their sense of subjectivity. The art of ‘doing everything to express what I feel’ should be a matter for therapy, not for performance,” another echoed. “Way to turn a music festival into hate festival. So sad and crazy,” another commented. While some X users argued that the bands were simply exercising their “freedom of speech”, their comments were mostly drowned out. “This is NOT free speech. This IS HATE SPEECH! Absolutely disgusting that this allowed,” one tweeted, with another noting, “I remember when music festivals were about coming together around music and unity with fellow humans. I guess this one is a Nazi death rally … glad I’m too old for this.” But fans of Kneecap were not fazed by the controversy. Gemma Gibson, 41, from Newcastle, told the Irish Times before their set she was “really excited” to see Kneecap perform, dismissing calls for the performance to be cancelled. “Well, that would be completely against everything that Glastonbury stands for,” she said. “This is where they should be.” Greg Robertson, 30, told the newspaper, “I don’t think politicians should really have too much of an impact on a weekend where everyone’s trying to have fun and trying to maybe create a more optimistic future.” To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "A massive leak from the so-called Panama Playlist database has exposed the private music tastes of some of the world’s most powerful figures. Vice President JD Vance is a big fan of the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt gets pumped up with Beyonce’s “Run the World (Girls)” — and there’s one very prominent politician who loves Nelly’s “Hot In Herre.” That’s all according to the Panama Playlists — a site that quietly went live Wednesday and claims to reveal the private music tastes of a slew of public figures. “I found the real Spotify accounts of celebrities, politicians, and journalists. “Many use their real names. With a little sleuthing, I could say with near-certainty: yep, this is them,” the anonymous eavesdropper wrote. “We’ve been scraping their accounts since summer 2024. “Playlists, live listening feed, everything. I know what songs they played, when, and how many times,” they wrote, also stating the project has not affiliation with company “Spotify.” The anonymous researcher told The Post that they became convinced in the authenticity of each account as the months of monitoring went on. “I gained confidence in each person by looking at lots of signals. An example is Pam Bondi. Her longtime partner is John Wakefield, and her profile has an old playlist called “john” and an old shared playlist with a user named ‘John Wakefield,’ so that gives me a lot of confidence it is her account.” “Karoline Leavitt’s profile has a playlist called ‘Baby Shower,’ and she had a baby a month after the playlist was made,” the owner of the website told The Post, emphasising they only collected publicly available information. It all seems to be a bit of summer fun, that reveals the questionable, ironic and sometimes too-on-the-nose music choices of America’s rich and powerful. “Heard of the Panama Papers? That exposed offshore bank accounts. This is about onshore vibes,” the site says. Here is a sample of what “Panama Playlists” found. Vice President JD Vance is a fan of the songs “I Want It That Way” by the Backstreet Boys and “One Time” by Justin Bieber, both of which appear on his oft-listened to “Making Dinner” playlist. The millennial veep also appears to be a fan of pop-punk, with several songs from the early aughts favourite Death Cab for Cutie appearing on his playlist “Gold On The Ceiling.” On that playlist, Vance shows off an eclectic taste in tunes, selecting songs “Fade Into You” by Mazzy Star, “Pepper,” by Butthole Surfers, “Signs” by band Tesla, and “Take a Walk” from Passion Pit. FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has three public playlists — “rap” “soft” and “loud” — which feature plenty of Eminem, also Death Cab for Cutie, and song “Young Dumb, Broke” from Khalid. Karoline Leavitt had the songs “Run the World (Girls)” by Beyonce and “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” from Cyndi Lauper on her “Baby Shower” playlist. Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson’s liked tracks on his Pandora account include “Parachutes” from the movie “Air Force One” and the “Finding Nemo/Nemo Egg” theme performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. He’s also into “One Night Love Affair” by Bryan Adams and “May It Be” by Enya. Social media gadfly Taylor Lorenz’s public playlists include “Older Millenial College Rager TBT” and “Breakup Songs” —- but her “Favs” include tracks “Romeo and Juliet” from Dire Straits and “You Can Get It If You Really Want” from reggae legend Jimmy Cliff. Pam Bondi prefers the more upbeat tracks on her playlist named “Pam” — including Nelly’s immortal jam “Hot In Herre,” “Hands to Myself” by Selena Gomez, and “Fix My Eyes” from band For King & Country.” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s “My Shazam Tracks” — meaning songs he likely looked up — include the well-known “Get Ur Freak On” by Missy Elliott, “Make Me Feel Your Love,” by Adele, and “Vivir Mi Vida” from Marc Anthony. Coinsbase CEO Brian Armstrong has a playlist called “Repeat” that is the song “Long Way Home” by Gareth Emery saved 60 times. And Florida Governer Ron DeSantis is a major classic rock fan with his only public playlist featuring iconic songs “Ring of Fire” by Johnny Cash, “Southern Nights” from the rhinestone cowboy Glen Campbell, and The Charlie Daniels Band’s “The Devil Went Down To Georgia.” This story first appeared in the New York Post and was republished with permission.

    "content": "He’s a social media sensation with more than 200 million views online, and now, the Tree of Wisdom has made a mega announcement. Yes, the Tree of Wisdom did catch The Wiggles cast off-guard when he pulled out those dance moves during filming. Dominic Field, as he’s known out of his vibrant green leafy costume, has exploded in popularity over the past year thanks to his signature set of chaotic routines on the Australian children’s program, which have made him a bona fide social media sensation with more than 200 million views. And just months after finding viral fame, Field is slated to headline his own national tour, with The Wiggles today announcing the upcoming ‘Tree of Wisdom Arena Spectacular Tour’ kicking off in November, as well as his own studio album to be released in October. Field’s public favour all stems back to The Wiggles’ recent reimagining of the catchy Irish folk song Rattlin’ Bog. In the music video, he breaks out into a series of chaotic dance moves that progressively get more and more adventurous. Among the hundreds of re-shares on TikTok, including from US reality star Khloe Kardashian, the general consensus has been: “I want whatever the Tree of Wisdom is having.” Aside from that, many viewers have also been eager to understand what went down on-set when it was filmed, with a flurry of comments pointing to a visibly mystified Purple Wiggle Lachy, who attempts to hold character as Field lets loose. Speaking to news.com.au, Field confirmed no-one knew just how hard he was going to go. “The way we work at The Wiggles … it wasn’t on the schedule four months in advance. You know? It was very much just like, we’ve got a week of filming and we’ll see what we can fit in,” Field says. “And so it was very much just, ‘OK next we’re doing the Rattlin’ Bog.’ It’s such difficult song to sing. There’s so many words. So it was a matter of, they’re [the core cast] locked into to what they need to do, and I’ve pretty much got free range, and my ultimate goal was to try to slip up Lachy, or slip up someone in the background. “Every time I’m dancing, I’m trying to catch someone off guard. I’m also thinking, ‘OK, what can I do next?’ And whatever comes out when it comes out. That’s what happens, and it always seems to get bigger and faster.” Fans can expect that signature energy for Field’s upcoming tour, with the set list comprising of Wiggles classics and music from the upcoming Tree of Wisdom album. Two tracks have been unveiled early today, including Field’s cover of Tina Turner’s iconic Nutbush City Limits featuring Yellow Wiggle Tsehay Hawkins. Field has a grand goal with the iconic dancefloor earworm, revealing The Wiggles have discovered the song is only a staple in Australia, despite Turner’s US roots. “We’ve realised recently that Australia is the only one who does the dance,” Field says. “We’ve been touring the world and we play this song and we just get these looks. Even in New Zealand, our close neighbours. It’s not much of a thing there. “No one knows the nutbush dance. So we’ve taken it on ourselves. We are going to be the international teachers of the nutbush dance.” Field, the youngest child of former Wiggles manager Paul Field and nephew of OG Blue Wiggle Anthony Field, who first appeared in the beloved group as a one-year-old in 1995, has also managed to transcend the target youth market, assembling a fanbase of what he coins “tree-nagers” and parents alike. Just weeks ago, Field set the Old Mates pub in New York alight when he whipped out his signature moves for dozens of adults, yet again, going viral on the platform. He’s chuffed by the admiration, mostly because he’s quietly been “that guy” on wedding dance floors for years. “I think it just really reminds everyone of that one guy at a wedding, or that one guy on the dance floor, who doesn’t really care what’s going on around him,” Field says. “I think the thing I’m proudest of the most is … What you see of the Tree is very much who I am. I am that guy at the wedding who’s just having the best time. “I’m the youngest of five children. So I’ve always been trying to get the attention of my parents and all that stuff. So it’s just me just having the most fun. And I think that resonates with people.” Presale tickets for ‘The Wiggles’ Tree of Wisdom Big Show Arena Spectacular Tour’,  by the Australian Fruit and Vegetable Industry, will be available from 1pm AEDT Tuesday July 29 for Amex Card members. General public tickets go on sale this Friday August 1 at 2pm. “It’s going to be in the round, which we haven’t done for quite some time. The original Wiggles did it way back in the day, but this new generation of Wiggles, we’re doing it in the round, in the arena. It’s gonna be spectacular,” Field says. “Of course, we’ll have the classic songs that everyone knows and loves from The Wiggles, but we’re throwing in some new stuff. There’s gonna be balls flying around, and of course, there’s gonna be some new stuff from the Tree of Wisdom album as well. It’s going to get people dancing and it’s going to bring that energy up.” THE WIGGLES’ TREE OF WISDOM ARENA TOUR DATES RAC Arena, Perth – Saturday, November 1 Thebarton Theatre, Adelaide – Sunday, November 9 Hobart Entertainment Centre, Hobart – Saturday, November 15 AIS Arena, Canberra – Saturday, November 22 John Cain Arena, Melbourne – Saturday, November 29 Brisbane Entertainment Centre, Brisbane – Saturday, December 6 Newcastle Entertainment Centre, Newcastle – Wednesday, December 10 Qudos Bank Arena, Sydney – Saturday, December 13 ICC, Sydney – Saturday, December 20 TRECC, Tamworth at Toyota 54th Tamworth Country Music Festival 2026 – Sunday, January 25, 2026 Liam and Noel Gallagher paid tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne on their first sold-out night at Wembley, and fans went absolutely wild.

After almost 20 years in the major record label system in Australia, Mauboy has severed ties with Warner Music to launch her emotional new single While I Got Time on her independent imprint Jamally. Mauboy and her co-writer PJ Harding were given a cryptic brief to write the powerful ballad, unaware it was intended to soundtrack the heart-wrenching departure of Lynne McGranger’s beloved character Irene from Home and Away. Seven has yet to confirm when McGranger’s final episode will air this month. The wildly popular actress, who is the favourite to take home the Gold Logie on Sunday, came up with the storyline of her character exiting the show after 33 years due to an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. She wanted to foster a national conversation about the disease and care of elderly patients. “There was no communication whatsoever that we were writing a song for Irene,” Mauboy said. “They asked us to write a song about crossing oceans, travelling, moving away and leaving family and having all these memories of the people that you love. “As travellers, as writers, as collaborators, we’ve experienced those times of sacrificing being away and missing home.” Mauboy and Sydney songwriter and producer Harding, who has penned Grammy nominated songs with Noah Cyrus, completed a rough demo in half a day. It was immediately sent to the Home and Away producers who called McGranger in to hear it. She was moved to tears. “The producers told me they wanted to talk to me and I was like ‘Well, you can’t fire me, I’ve left!’” McGranger said. “They played me the song and the footage (of her final scenes) and it is so powerful and moving. “I filmed the bloody thing, and I watch it with the song and I’m crying.” It’s been a year of big changes in Mauboy’s life, both personally and professionally. She welcomed her first child, daughter Mia, with husband Themeli Magripilis in January. After three years in development, in March the pop star and award-winning actress launched a sun-care brand Desert Rose, inspired by her childhood in the Northern Territory outback under Australia’s harsh sun. And now she has launched Jamally, her indie record label. Sony exercised their option to sign the 16-year-old singer from Darwin when she was runner-up on the fourth season of Australian Idol in 2006. She parted ways with the major label in 2020 after frustrations with the executives’ creative vision for her next album and signed with rival Warner Music. Mauboy released her fifth record, the top 10 hit Yours Forever last February. But she reached another impasse over her artistic future and decided to go independent. “I’ve dedicated my whole life for the last 15 years or more to music and the label and their process and I wasn’t really doing what I deeply wanted, or the permission to do it,” she said. “The decision came to go out on my own and yes, there’s gonna be a lot more things to do, but I’m willing to take that risk (instead of) spending time doing the same thing over and over again.” Wanting to start a family and spend more time with her and her husband’s clans also galvanised her decision to take full control over her career. “I’ve always wanted to be a mum. I come from a big family so I’ve wanted that for myself, I wanted that for my family and to reconnect after that time away, the time I’d sacrificed of not even being with them, or dipping in and dipping out. “I want to be there fully, mentally, physically, and loving everything that I am actually doing and making a decision on. I’m making the choices and I’m actually doing it my way. For the first time.” Mauboy will give ‘While I Got Time’ its live premiere at the National Indigenous Music Awards in Darwin on August 9, where she will also be inducted to the NIMAs Hall of Fame, alongside revered First Nations artists including Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, Ruby Hunter, Kev Carmody and Gurrumul. She said she was deeply humbled for the honour from her community. “I did think about how do I as an artist who’s still making music, still trying to discover where my place is, receive such recognition, so high in the music industry, when you look at the other Hall of Famers, the giants,” she said. “Have I done enough? To get into the Hall of Fame, you are meant to have done everything. “I am deeply humbled and I keep thinking about how I’ve always gone into music doing it for community. The NIMAs was the birth of who I am as an artist. “This is going to make me work even more harder. I’m not finished, I want to go to the ends of the earth with music.” While I Got Time is out now. The TV Week Logie Awards air live on Seven from 7pm on Sunday. Justin Timberlake has released a lengthy public statement detailing his secret battle with a “debilitating” illness. A massive leak from the so-called Panama Playlist database has exposed the private music tastes of some of the world’s most powerful figures.

Jennifer Lopez shocked fans when she hit the stage in dangerously high-cut bodysuits during her WorldPride performance in Washington, DC on Saturday. Created by New York-based brand The Blonds, the sparkly silver thong-style nearly caused a wardrobe malfunction during a rendition of her new song, Save Me Tonight. Lopez’s look also included a plunging neckline and grommets studding the barely there piece. Lopez, who works with stylists Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn, rocked the bodysuit with coordinating shimmery silver over-the-knee boots. The On The Floor singer, 55, smouldered in her signature bombshell make-up look, finishing her glam with long waves of honey-blonde hair.

The second look, courtesy of fashion designer Rey Ortiz, included black patent leather and faux beige cutouts that framed her abs and hips. And the sultry looks didn’t stop there — Lopez bared her toned body in a sparkly bra and matching tiny bottoms with a flame design. “Major shoutout to @theblondsny for slaying my sparkly World Pride stage looks — and to @fashionbyreyortiz for that fierce black catsuit moment,” Lopez wrote in an Instagram caption. “You all didn’t just understand the assignment, you rewrote it. Queens of the stage, crowned and confirmed!” Fans were loving the daring looks, with one commenting, “Iconic but also the cut of that bodysuit is wilddddddddddd I need a documentary on how that works.” Another said, “Your energy and power is unmatched. What a show you gave us my love!! The queen is back and a third wrote, “Add runway model to your resume baby!!! Tens across the board.” Per Out Magazine, Lopez stopped to thank her queer fans amid her performance. “Over the years, your love and your support have been a source of strength for me and today I am here to celebrate you,” she said to the crowd. “I’m so happy to be able to be here to celebrate community, diversity, love, and freedom.” This story originally appeared on Page Six and is republished here with permission.

Oasis fans who turned out for the iconic band’s concerts in Wembley were definitely not disappointed, as this incredible footage shows. The band, led by Noel and Liam Gallagher, have been back on tour since July 4 – reuniting after a bust up broke up the band 16 years ago. They are currently performing in London as part of seven sold-out shows at the iconic Wembley Stadium, The Sun reports. A new video posted to Instagram shot from the stage behind the famous band and looking out to the crowd, showed thousands of people jumping up and down as the band kicked off one of their most popular songs. The stadium moved as one as Noel played guitar and frontman Liam urged the crowd on by waving his arms up in the air. The video was shared to the official Oasis Instagram account where fans flooded it with positive comments. “Everytime we see these clips it’s so refreshing to see the crowd enjoying themselves, and not watching through their screens,” wrote one person. Another added: “A sea of Oasis fans in 2025 what a time to be alive … Thank you guys this tour has been better than I have imagined it would be.” A third commented: “Best night with the best band!” And a fourth posted: “Wow! Regardless of whether you are a fan of band or not, this is amazing.” Oasis played its first shows at Wembley in 16 years and in the first concert on Friday paid tribute to Black Sabbath frontman, Ozzy Osbourne, who died on Tuesday aged 76. As the band played its 1994 Top Ten hit, Live Forever, a giant image of Ozzy appeared on the screens in the stadium. The brothers also sang the track Rock ’N’ Roll Star, from the same year, in honour of Ozzy, who was the self-proclaimed Prince of Darkness. Liam told the 81,000-strong crowd: “I want to dedicate this one to Ozzy Osbourne — a rock ’n’ roll star.” Earlier in the week, Oasis sent fans wild by releasing a live track from the reunion tour. The live rendition of one of Oasis’ most famous songs, Cigarettes and Alcohol, was released after the band also dropped Slide Away, which was recorded and released from their first date in Cardiff. Oasis will perform five more concerts at Wembley on July 30 and August 2 and 3. They will return towards the end of their tour for two more dates on September 27th and 28th.

A fan shared the footage of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin singing up close — with the disgraced former CEO cuddling Cabot on a balcony behind him, reports the New York Post. “POV: Trying to get the best photo of Coldplay but you end up getting this viral affair as well,” the caption read, with the pair seen swinging to the music together in the first row of the mezzanine. Byron and Cabot — who are both married to other people — were caught copying up at the concert when they were unexpectedly caught on the kiss-cam in a notoriously viral video. The pair, while initially smiling, started to panic under the spotlight, with Cabot quickly covering her face and Byron ducking out of view, the viral video shows.

Shoppers are exposing the bizarre things they’ve found at supermarkets, including the bones of an entirely devoured roast chicken. A picture recently shared on social media showed a bag of Coles Roast Chicken discovered at the Southland, Victoria, store. However, instead of the bag being filled with a chicken, all it contained was the ravaged carcass left behind by a seemingly hungry customer. “A customer ate a whole rotisserie chicken in the store and left a bag full of bones in the tissue aisle,” a Reddit user, who claimed to work at the supermarket giant, said. For the best lifestyle coverage in Australia - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. Some social media users found the act of eating a whole chicken hilarious — and were impressed that someone was able to get away with such a blatant act of theft. “Gotta commend them for not only their commitment but discretion. I mean how does one eat an ENTIRE chicken without getting caught? Either they’ve done this enough to know how to be discrete or they huffed that thing,” one person commented. Another said; “Put it in the basket and walk up and down each aisle. You realise pretty quickly the general public doesn’t care about you lol.” “Well it’s acceptable to eat a few grapes why can’t someone check the chicken is not well prepared? Lucky it wasn’t the hound ‘Think I’ll take two chickens’,” one commented. One added: “Honestly I’m impressed. The tissue aisle was probably a tactical move tbh.” “Won’t be hard to spot on the CCTV but damn that’s effort eating the whole damn chicken,” another social media user added. One added: “Probably some gym bro.” “You know what if I saw this at work, I wouldn’t even be mad. This is impressive and funny while not leaving a huge mess to clean up,” another said. One commented: “I reckon most people would be surprised by how often this happens.” “They probably didn’t eat it they probably shredded it up and put it in a different bag or hid it inside something so they didn’t have to pay for it,” one commented. One social media user called it “grub behaviour” but others gave the customer the benefit of the doubt, saying it was likely an act of desperation. “Yeah, if it was a homeless or hungry poor person, I’m glad they ate it,” one said. Another added: “Tbh, in this economy, I can kinda respect it.” “If someone is doing it that rough they need to do this to get a nice chicken dinner, and not even be able to sit and enjoy it, they need it more that I do,” one commented. One said: “Must have been starving, they inhaled it. My friends work at Coles and Woolworths and see homeless people come in and eat but also purchase a drink or something and I get it you gotta eat.” It’s not unusual to find something slightly off at a retail store. Workers around the world have reported finding everything from open chip packets gorged on while strolling the aisles, used nappies and even urine in vases. Internet personality Emily Solberg found a stash of KFC’s Popcorn Chicken hidden inside a gumboot at Walmart in January. Meanwhile in 2022, a Woolworths Coffs Harbour worker found a half eaten kebab hidden on the shelves. The worker labelled it a “pig” act and said working in the team that restocked shelves at night, sights like this weren’t uncommon. Another picture showed a corn relish dip shoved into a box of Chicken Crimpy Shapes. Last year, during the peak of the egg shortage, Australians were doing their best to secure a perfect carton. So, they would dump broken eggs onto the shelf. The Pick and Mix section of supermarkets have always proved controversial with a pigeon being spotted at a Coles store earlier this year. Last year, a customer called out another shopper for simply sticking their hand in and taking a snack for the road. Just days after drawing huge crowds at 4am, an American chain that opened in Sydney has introduced strict rules amid Aussie’s complaints. The owners of a rapidly growing fast food chain have responded to customer concerns after an outbreak at one of its locations. Sydneysiders have called a suburban pub's steak special 'ridiculous', with the price tag higher than some of the city's most prestigious restaurants. Our Apps",

    "content": "When two sisters went for a coffee in Bondi recently, a stranger’s pointed question made them wonder: is looking “too good” now a faux pas in Australia? A Sydney woman was doing a classic coffee run with her sister in Bondi before a day of shopping the boutiques in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs. Melanie Quick and her sister Courtney both have a penchant for good style, but as they ordered their matchas and waited for them to arrive, a stranger made a comment to them that caught them off guard. They asked, “Why are you so dressed up? Where are you going?” Ms Quick was wearing a cream quarter-zip sweater tucked into a slouchy silk maxi skirt and flats, while Courtney wore a faux fur coat and black jeans. While many might consider their outfits ‘extra’, by Aussie standards, where everyone seems to get around in activewear, it was no ballgown and heels. So it made her wonder, why does it feel so wrong to dress nicely in Australia these days? The ‘overdressed’ remark “My mum always encouraged us to wear what makes us feel our best, and always shares stories about how stylish her own mother was, so I guess a sense of self-expression runs in our family,” Ms Quick told news.com.au. “I always found so much joy in putting together an outfit, even if it’s for something simple, like getting a coffee. I don’t enjoy wearing activewear unless I’m working out or at home.” So when the stranger asked them that question, with a subtle air of judgment, she responded quite directly and refused to feel embarrassed. “I just said we were here for coffee and offered no other explanation,” she said. Others agree we have a fashion issue down under After making a TikTok about the encounter, she was met with overwhelming support from others who thought Aussies were far too comfortable dressing down. One comment read: “Australia is honestly one of the most poorly dressed countries … every other country I’ve travelled to, people dress to the 10s wherever they go but here we call it a ‘day out in town’ if it’s more than a T-shirt and jeans”. Another noted: “I found that when I was in Europe, genuinely no one batted an eye at my outfits, everyone was so stylish and put together, especially in Italy. But when I dress like this in Australia, all I get are stares and questions like ‘Who are you dressing up for?’ Ummm myself? We hate individuality here”. Is Tall Poppy Syndrome at play? Ms Quick believes this has to do with our laid-back, outdoor culture, where wearing athleisure is the unofficial uniform. According to a recent study, 78 per cent of Aussies say they wear activewear as casual wear when they’re out and about. Around 40 per cent of people said they wore activewear most days, if not every day. But she also thinks something deeper is at play that contributes to people not wanting to appear as if they’re trying too hard. “When someone dresses a bit differently or is ‘overdressed’ – Tall Poppy Syndrome comes into play, which affects how we react to confidence and ambition,” she said. Tall Poppy Syndrome is an Australian term that describes the tendency of people to belittle or undermine those who stand out. “Even something as small as dressing nicely can be seen as being attention-seeking,” she added. Perhaps this is a collective ‘cultural cringe’ According to Jacob Loaf, an Aussie fashion commentator, this phenomenon is part of our country’s collective ‘cultural cringe’ towards people who take pride in their fashion sense. “Australians fear dressing up,” he said, adding that this exists for men as well as women. “When people even want to wear pants and nice shoes as opposed to a Gymshark tee and Kmart pants, it’s frowned upon.” “Why is hyper-casual clothing the societal norm?” he asked. Why people dress better overseas In fashion forums and Reddit communities, this topic is also a common subject of discussion. “Why do we dress so casually here compared to Americans or the French?” someone asked in the r/AusFemaleFashion forum. Many comments mentioned our climate, citing our year-round warm weather as a reason why people choose less formal, more relaxed clothing. “Coats, blazers, and jackets that can add polish to an outfit aren’t needed much,” said one. Some also pointed out that we don’t have many “walkable” cities, which means people spend a lot of time, often on public transport, getting around, meaning they opt for more comfortable outfits. Another raised the point that it was to do with our limited access to upmarket clothing labels. “Our mainstream fashion is very basic, and our niche brands can be over-the-top colourful – so if you want something nicer and elegant, it’s next to impossible to find,” claimed one. Meanwhile, someone else claimed that it’s because Aussies generally don’t have many formal events to go to, and our lives revolve more around everyday activities. ‘Embrace individual style’ Despite all these discussions, Ms Quick says she isn’t going to reconsider her fashion choices and will continue to dress in ways that make her feel confident. “I think it’s time we start to embrace individual style and celebrate people who want to express themselves through fashion,” she said. “At the end of the day, what we wear is an extension of who we are, and I love seeing people feel confident and happy in their clothes. I truly think that deserves to be celebrated.” Collapsed Australian fashion label Tigerlily has emerged from a turbulent two-year period to make a dramatic retail comeback just in time for a milestone anniversary. A hundred real chests from 100 real women, yet censorship laws prevent it from being shared online. So, why are we still so afraid of bodies? Think op shops have lost the plot with sky-high prices? Here’s why your outrage is missing the bigger picture. Our Apps",

A Queensland mother has warned fellow parents after claiming her children found a butcher’s knife hidden inside a play structure at a popular Gold Coast play centre. Tiani Palmer described the moment her family’s celebration turned into a nightmare. “On the 6th of July 2025, we celebrated my daughter’s 4th birthday at Bella’s Wonderland in Southport. What was supposed to be a magical day quickly turned into something deeply disturbing and dangerous,” she wrote on Facebook. According to Palmer, her six-year-old son and two other boys of the same age were playing in the main playground area when they stumbled upon the large knife hidden inside the equipment. “While playing in the main playground area, my 6-year-old son and two other 6-year-old boys found a large butcher’s knife hidden down the side of the mats inside the play structure. A KNIFE. In a children’s playground.” Palmer said she immediately handed the weapon to staff, who she claimed reacted with indifference. “I was in shock and incredibly concerned, not just for my own children but for every family that walks through those doors,” he said. Palmer said she attempted to contact the play centre’s management but was repeatedly stonewalled. “The next day, I called the centre multiple times, asking to speak with the manager. I was told she was ‘sick’ and would call me back when she could. I never heard from her. I even followed up with an email. Still nothing. “For the price you pay to host a birthday party at these types of places, you would think your child would be safe and it’s a safe environment. My daughter’s birthday could have ended in absolute tragedy.” “I’m beyond disappointed and honestly disgusted by how this situation was handled.” She has reported the incident to Queensland Police. However, a Queensland Police Service spokesperson told theGold Coast Bulletin the centre also lodged an online report to police. They have so far been unable to determine how the knife got there. “Officers spoke with management and staff, however it remains unknown who placed the knife at the location or when it was placed there,” the spokesperson said. “CCTV footage did not assist with identifying any offender. At this time, there are no further avenues of investigation.” A fed-up mum’s confrontation with her daughter’s alleged bullies has racked up half a million views, but some people think she crossed the line.

    "content": "It’s said you need to walk 10,000 steps a day, but a study has shown that this commonly spouted knowledge may be off the mark. Ten thousand steps per day has been widely recommended as the standard benchmark for physical activity — but a new study suggests that just 7000 could be enough to boost essential health markers. Researchers from the University of Sydney conducted a review of 57 studies spanning more than 10 countries, which tracked participants’ steps and health outcomes. Led by Professor Melody Ding from the School of Public Health, the team looked at how different daily step counts impacted the risk of dying from heart disease and cancer, as well as the risk of developing cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression, according to a university press release. And it turns out, you may not need as many steps as was first thought. Researchers found that walking at least 7000 steps a day was linked to improvement in eight major health outcomes, including heart disease, dementia and depressive symptoms. “Any increase in daily steps, even modest ones like 4000 steps, delivers health benefits compared to very low activity levels,” Ding toldFox News. “When possible, targeting around 7000 steps per day can substantially reduce risks for many chronic diseases and adverse health outcomes. “Even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2000 to 4000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain.” Higher step counts beyond 7000 may add extra benefits, but the improvement rate slows, she noted. The results were published in The Lancet Public Health journal. In particular, the researchers found that walking 7000 steps a day reduced the risk of death by 47 per cent, almost exactly the same as 10000 steps. That same step benchmark was also linked to a 38 per cent reduced risk of dementia and a 22 per cent reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, both only slightly lower than the benefit of 10,000 steps, the release stated. “Significant health improvements” were reported when people increased from 2000 steps per day to anywhere between 5000 and 7000. “Aiming for 7000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn’t been looked at before,” said Professor Ding in the release. “However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts, such as increasing from 2000 to 4000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain.” For those who are already very active and consistently hitting 10,000+ steps, Ding said, “keep it up — there’s no need to cut back”. The researchers also noted that stepping doesn’t need to happen all at once or require intentional exercise. “Everyday movements count — like getting off the bus a stop earlier or choosing stairs over elevators,” Ding advised. “Small, incidental bouts throughout the day add up and contribute to health. Embrace opportunities to move more in practical, enjoyable ways.” There were some limitations in the study, the researchers noted. “For some outcomes, we have a small number of studies,” Ding told Fox News. There are also some study-level biases, she said. “For example, people who are already unwell will take fewer steps because of their health conditions,” Ding said. “And while there is an indication that the dose-response may be different for older adults, we didn’t have enough data for all outcomes to explore it.” It’s also important to note that while walking offers great health benefits, it is not a complete “package” in itself, she noted. “Everyday movements count — like getting off the bus a stop earlier or choosing stairs over elevators,” Ding said. “Try to also incorporate strength training and mobility exercise into a weekly routine for more complete health benefits.” In next steps, the researchers plan to use these findings to shape future physical activity guidelines.

    "content": "Thaddeus was born from an embryo frozen before either of his parents even started school. The world’s “oldest baby” has been born from an embryo frozen before either of his parents even started school. Thaddeus Daniel Pierce was delivered on July 26 to parents Lindsey and Tim Pierce, of Ohio – over three decades after his embryo was frozen. The tot, who has broken the record for the oldest baby, even has a 30-year-old sister – who is now a mum herself to a 10-year-old girl, The Sun reports. The title was previously held by twins who were created from embryos frozen 30 years before their birth. Lindsay told MIT Technology Review: “We didn’t go into it thinking we would break any records. We just wanted a baby.” Thaddeus’s embryo was created along with three others during a course of IVF in the 1990s for Linda Archerd and her then-husband. One of the embryos was implanted into Linda who conceived her now 30-year-old daughter. The remaining embryos were put in long-term storage before being put up for embryo adoption when Linda and her partner separated. Embryo adoptions are more typical in the US – particularly at Christian clinics – to help families struggling to conceive. After seven years trying for a baby, Lindsey and Tim signed up for the same program and were offered Thaddeus’s embryo. “We had a rough birth, but we’re both doing well now,” Lindsey said. “He is so chill. We are in awe that we have this precious baby,” she added. ‘Snow babbies’ In 2017, a baby girl was born from a 25-year-old embryo in what was then a world first in the US. Little Emma Wren Gibson weighed 6lbs 8oz (about 2.9kg) and measured 20 inches (about 50cm) long when she was born. Her parents, Tina and Benjamin Gibson, said their daughter’s record status was their last priority, focusing only on her health, adding they felt “thankful and blessed” to have her. They said they were surprised when they were told the exact age of the embryo, thawed on March 13 at the National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC). “Do you realise I’m only 25? This embryo and I could have been best friends,” Tina told CNN. Tina, who was 26 at the time, said she just wanted a baby and didn’t care if it was going to be a world record or not. “We’re just so thankful and blessed. She’s a precious Christmas gift from the Lord.” Baby Emma was created via IVF for another couple but had been left in storage for someone else. Embryos like this are called “snow babies” – potential human lives left on ice waiting to be born. Seven years ago Tina and Benjamin got married knowing they would not be able to have biological children as Benjamin has cystic fibrosis. They had fostered several children and were planning on adoption before having the embryo implanted. This article originally appeared in The Sun and has been reproduced with permission.

    "content": "The retailers are beefing up an aisle in response to an increased demand for a product Aussies previously wouldn’t buy at the supermarket. Supermarkets were once just a place to pick up groceries, but now shoppers are flocking to the aisles to pick up a very different kind of product. The beauty offerings at retailers such as Coles and Woolworths has been rapidly expanding in recent years, with consumers now given more options than ever when it comes to skin, hair and body care. And data shows the beefed-up range is a huge success with shoppers, with Woolies revealing it has seen a “double-digit growth in skin care in the past quarter alone”. “We’re focused on bringing the latest on-trend beauty brands and skincare products to our stores so that our customers can enjoy affordable luxuries at home,” a spokesperson for the supermarket giant told news.com.au’s The Beauty Diary. “As well as being affordable, we find that customers enjoy the convenience of picking up all their beauty and skincare needs in one shop.” The growing interest in the beauty aisle has seen Woolworths secure deals to be the first Australian retailer stocking several international brands, including Tree Hut, Daise and Billie, which the supermarket said has been driving new customers through its doors. It’s not just skincare that is getting snapped up, with “the fresh food people” selling around 8000 mascaras every day – that’s three million mascaras a year. “Customers love that they can also take advantage of our Everyday Rewards program to earn points to spend back in store, as well as keeping an eye out for our weekly catalogue for specials,” the spokesperson said. “On top of our supermarkets, Big W also sells a huge range of beauty products, making it easier for customers to get their hands on these popular brands.” Coles is experiencing a similar surge in customer demand for beauty products, with the retailer stating that economic strain on Aussie households is a key part of the change to shopping habits. “At a time when cost of living pressures remain a challenge for many people, Coles is committed to helping with a range of great value products across the supermarket and that includes in the beauty aisle,” a spokesperson told The Beauty Diary. “Supermarket beauty brands are a great alternative for customers wanting to still indulge and experience high-quality beauty products, but at an affordable price.” But it’s not just the selection of products that is on the up, but the quality too, with Aussies regularly raving about supermarket beauty buys that exceed expectation. One brand that is regularly praised for being “insanely effective” is Dermal Therapy, an affordable Australian skincare brand with an extensive range, much of which is sold in Coles and Woolies. Founded by Steven and Shelley Sher, Dermal Therapy has been steadily increasing its own product range recently, with the launch of its Overnight Face Mask and a line of Tinted Lip Balms. “Whilst our brand was and still is predominantly pharmacy focused, we understand that our customers don’t always have time to go to multiple stores and being able to add your favourite skincare line to your grocery trolley is an option people would like to have,” Mrs Sher told The Beauty Diary. “We pride ourselves on our accessibility across multiple retailers instore and online.” The brand’s ethos of “being affordable and highly effective” stems from a “very personal experience of struggling to keep our son’s eczema under control when he was a toddler”, Mrs Sher explained, stating it caused a financial and emotional toll that she and her husband used to create the Dermal Therapy range. “We used the pain of our experience and turned it into our passion to make a real positive change in the therapeutic skincare space, which we are proud to say with almost 100 products now in our range, and many thousands of happy customers – we really do deliver on our ‘Dermal Therapy Promise’, which is developing seriously good skincare, that actually works.” It appears to be paying off for the brand, with customers regularly raving about its line on social media. Several of its products have gone viral on TikTok in the last year, including the Crystal Deodorant roll-on and its Original Lip Balm. “It’s the absolute best,” wrote one delighted customer. “This brand is so unsexy but it doesn’t matter because it works,” claimed another. Mrs Sher said it always makes her day when she sees a positive review, adding feedback can often help them decide what new product to bring out next. “Following on from our hugely successful overnight lip mask, we saw the potential in an overnight face mask,” she said, explaining the story behind the brand’s newest product. “We had already made inroads into face care both through our lip balms and with our very dry face cream so knew that this was something that would be welcomed by consumers. “The overnight face mask contains Hyalaronic Acid, Ceramides, Peptides, Collagen & Urea plus much more. In total there are over 30 skin loving ingredients packed into that little tube.” If you have a question about a beauty product or an item you’d like to see road-tested in The Beauty Diary, let us know.

    "content": "A pilates instructor has called out an all too common act that most of us are guilty of doing at least once during exercise. An Aussie pilates instructor has called out an all too common exercise act that most of us are guilty of. Adelle Petropoulos, 30, teaches pilates full time and does four classes a week. After a recent class, the Melbourne woman took to TikTok to rant about something she sees in the studio all the time. “If this ever happens in your pilates class, just stop moving. You’ve done your class, everyone’s worked their little tushies off. The instructor’s put on harmonious music,” she said. “Find your quiet, still space — that is not instructions for you to get up, take your straps off and start cleaning your reformer.” She said all that can be heard throughout the quiet time at the end of the class are the sounds of cleaning spray and noisy personal items being bundled up. Ms Petropoulos advised people to either leave before the quiet music, or don’t come to the class at all as it interrupts others who choose to stay. Speaking to news.com.au, Ms Petropoulos said as an instructor her job is to create the best 45-minute experience for every person in the room. “When people start packing up before class ends, it disrupts that shared energy. It sends a message — intentionally or not — that the last few minutes don’t matter, when in fact, they’re often the most important: the wind-down, the breath work, the integration. Those moments are where the magic happens,” she told news.com.au. “It’s not just about etiquette, it’s about respect — for the practice, the instructor, and most importantly, for the people around you who are still trying to be present. Everyone deserves that full experience.” She said she understood that most people didn’t mean any harm by it, as they’re just busy, but it can be incredibly “disruptive” and “pulls others out of the moment”. Ms Petropoulos said most people agreed with what she said in the social media rant. Another action, from her perspective, that causes similar issues is using your phone in class. She mentioned that most people come in with a great energy and respect for the space. “Just a reminder that we’re all human — no one’s perfect! But if we can all stay present, support each other, and treat the space with care, it makes a huge difference. Pilates is about more than movement — it’s a shared community lead experience, and when we all show up fully, the energy in the room becomes something really special,” Ms Petropoulos said. Simon Ngo, from Flow Athletic, described Ms Petropoulos’ video as “spot on and accurate”. He said while leaving during the cool down portion of the class at Flow Athletic, due to the relative intensity of the classes, is quite rare it seems to be a fairly common occurrence in pilates in general. “I just feel like it’s a ‘what a shame’ moment. It’s as though you’ve gone to the effort of checking out the dessert menu but not ordered anything,” he said. “Or more accurately, like you’ve ordered the dessert, it’s arrived and you’ve decided to leave.” He said people should stick around for that part of the class, as it’s part of it for a reason. “If you don’t start a class without a warm up, why would you not finish with a cool down,” he said. “Otherwise, a class would have been advertised 5 mins shorter. Plus, your instructors probably would have gone above and beyond to plan these Zen closing out moments. “As much as people are time poor and, rather because of it, these few minutes of slowing down and reconnecting with ourselves are the stress-buster and self-care everyone needs in these of world of being busy today.” He said in 2025, securing a spot in a pilates class almost rivals getting into the housing market so, if you land a spot, “stay for the full experience”.

    "content": "A warning has been issued about a popular bin hack to make getting to the kerb a little easier on bin night. It’s the bin hack that has been described as “genius” online, but a viral trick showing how to pull two of the household rubbish containers at once has prompted a waste management company to issue a warning. The unique method, shared by an Australian mum last week, involves connecting two bins together using the lids and hooking them to a car’s towbar in order to pull them both at the same time. But the hack, which was first popularised by an American content creator last year, has sparked a warning from Veolia, a waste management company that operates across Australia and New Zealand. “It’s not uncommon for people with long driveways to hitch their bins to the towbar of their vehicles; we have also seen bins towed by bicycles, propelled by leaf blowers, and even guided by electric skateboards,” the spokesperson told news.com.au. “But bins are designed to be used in the ‘normal’ way. That’s what we recommend to keep yourself safe and the place tidy.” The brand also suggested that anyone “struggling” to bring their bins back in should “get a neighbour to help”, stressing Aussies’ safety was its number one concern. “We all love our bins, but instead of giving them a tow take the opportunity to get those steps in and walk them to the kerb â€• just watch out for your shins,” the spokesperson added. Its comments come after a video went viral demonstrating how frustrated bin users could save time with the tedious task. “This is super niche, but this is something I wish I learnt sooner — how to drag two bins at the same time when you don’t have any hands,” the Aussie mum-of-two said on social media. “I just chuck the first lid inside the second [bin], close the second lid and yank it up so it’s giving a little piggy back and then off you go.” The mum then attached the bins to the trailer hitch on the back of her car, and then drove down the long drive way on what appeared to be a rural property. Despite concerns from officials, many social media users appreciated the information, declaring they would give it a crack themselves. “Love it. My son sits in the boot and pulls them up for me while I drive slowly,” one social media user said. Another added: “It didn’t work for me.” “I put a hook on the lower part of the red bin,” one commented. One social media user said: “OMG YES!!!! This is game changing living in a house with a battle axe driveway.” “OK genius but how bloody long is your driveway,” another commented. The “mind-blowing” tactic went viral in May last year after it was demonstrated by American creator Cade Grier, in a video that has been viewed tens of millions of times. An Aussie comedian who “missed out” on a viral product at the hardware store was gobsmacked when a staffer went “above and beyond”. The price tag of one item spotted in a popular DIY chain has raised eyebrows — but some have argued it was fair. One fed-up bloke is sick of city slickers ignoring one of the country’s most basic rules. And it seems the internet agrees with him. Our Apps",

    "content": "After a few months of doing this trendy workout, studies have shown you could appear noticeably taller. A trendy workout has been praised not only for improving fitness and flexibility but also for its potential to make you look taller. Pilates, which has soared in popularity in recent years, is said to increase people’s height due to its posture-improving benefits. Through pilates, strengthening and lengthening the core and spinal muscles can help you stand straighter, reduce slouching or spinal compression, and potentially add centimetres in height by promoting better alignment. Scientific studies have shown that pilates enhances postural alignment by increasing head and spine angles and decreasing thoracic kyphosis (the ‘hunchback’ appearance) and lumbar lordosis (the curve in the lower back). This improved alignment supports a taller, straighter look, creating the illusion of added height. One study found that this exercise style could increase height by up to 2.7 cm, especially after 10 weeks of pilates mat training. The researchers noted that this gain reflects better postural alignment, not real bone growth. Another controlled trial reported a significant height increase in a pilates group of middle-aged women, attributed to improved posture. Simon Ngo, Director of Pilates & Yoga at Flow Athletic, said that this effect is more about “regaining our height” than actually growing taller. “Due to gravity and us holding ourselves upright, over time the spine gets compressed and congested. Movements in all planes and directions, which are typically part of a pilates class, help decompress the spine and let us feel longer and taller,” he told news.com.au. He mentioned he personally feels more “lengthened” after pilates due to certain movements he includes in his classes. “Spinal flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation help the most,” he explained. “In other words, any movements that involve bending forward, back, side to side, or twisting will help, with back bending being the most effective in countering the effects of prolonged sitting in today’s lifestyle.” He mentioned that visible posture improvements won’t happen overnight, but with consistent effort, “perhaps 30 sessions or more” you might notice some changes. Chloe Atkinson, 25, told news.com.au that she has noticed an increase in height since starting pilates at age 17. “I’m hypermobile, and the body awareness pilates gave me helped me stand properly with less pressure on my knees, which made me seem taller,” she said. “I’m about 5’8” and a half. Before pilates, I measured consistently at 5’7”. I also started strength training at 21, which helped my posture too.” Emma Maslen, 49, realised she was getting shorter over the years because of poor posture. Since beginning pilates three months ago and practising five to six days a week leading up to her wedding, she now “finally” has good posture, reduced her “hunchback,” and appears taller. “I would estimate I gained a few centimetres, back to my original height,” she revealed. Deepak Shukla, 35, said that after sticking with pilates, he went from being a “slouched office worker” to a “confident six-footer”. “Sure, the height might be due to better posture, but it feels real when I walk around feeling like I’m owning the room!” he said.

    "content": "A Sydney institution beloved by celebrities and locals alike has announced its sudden closure after 20 years in business. A beloved Sydney institution has announced it is “closing its doors” after 20 years, leaving loyal customers devastated. Jocelyn Petroni, a highly-regarded facialist, confirmed the closure of her namesake salon in Woollahra on Tuesday. The clinic, which has been operating on Queen Street since 2005, has built up a legion of customers from across Sydney – with Petroni regularly treating the skin of the mega famous, including Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie, Kendall Jenner, Dua Lipa, Rita Ora and Nicole Kidman. “Personally connecting with clients and sharing my gift of touch has been one of the most deeply rewarding experiences of my life,” she said. “This next chapter for me is one of growth, where I can evolve the healing experience I have been gifted with, share my knowledge and inspire many more people. “Stepping away from the day-to-day of running a salon will allow me the time and space to create a true impact.” Petroni, who has been described as Sydney’s “go-to woman for plump, dewy skin”, is famed for her unique technique that embraces reiki, a Japanese form of “energy healing”. But the treatments didn’t come cheap, with her signature 60-minute “Heart Chakra” facial setting customers back $350. The business’ last day will be Saturday, August 16, with Petroni thanking customers for their support. “Thank you for trusting me with your skin, for your energy, and for the kindness, connection and unwavering support you have shown me over the years,” she said. “You have been an integral part in making my business a success, and for making my heart so full. I am so grateful.” Since news of the salon’s closure was announced, fans have been quick to share their devastation, but wished Petroni the best as she “takes on advisory roles” with brands and continues her ambassadorships. “Will miss your beautiful salon though I wish you all the best for your next exciting new chapter,” one wrote. “A huge loss for Sydney, but a very exciting step in your future,” agreed another. As one shared: “What a legacy.” The closure of the cult-beauty venue comes after luxury skincare brand La Mer unveiled the celebrity facialist as its new Australian facial advisor, according to Vogue Australia. “With over 20 years of experience, Petroni is set to bring her holistic approach to beauty and philosophy on skin health to the brand’s continued commitment to inner and outer beauty,” the brand said. “Having earned a dedicated longstanding client list of celebrities, her dedication to caring for the complexion through meticulous care and results-based treatments has made her one of the most sought-after skin experts globally.” Petroni, who attained a scholarship to study beauty therapy in 2000, said she was “thrilled” by her new role with the prestigious beauty brand, adding she’s been a “long-time fan” and user of its products. She was previously signed by Chanel as their first official manicurist, collaborating with the brand for eight years. Our Apps",

    "content": "They say people are lazy when they don’t lift a finger but fitness influencer Liu Weiqiang’s finger is not like everyone elses. Liu Weiqiang has broken a Guinness World record, and all he had to do was, quite literally, lift a finger. The Chinese fitness influencer deadlifted a jaw-dropping 144 kilograms with just his middle finger, breaking the previous record set by Egmond Molina, who achieved a one-finger deadlift of 138.5 kilograms in March 2024. To put 144 kilograms into perspective, that’s roughly the weight of a washer and dryer combo, a bathtub full of water, a small motorbike, or even two full kegs of beer. Yep. So, very impressive. To achieve this whopping accomplishment, Liu built a weighted device he could lift with just one finger. He clipped a carabiner to a sturdy fitness pole and loaded it with four 25 kilogram plates and two 20 kilogram plates. Then, while in a deadlift position - legs apart and a neutral spine - he looped his right middle finger around the carabiner and pulled the weight up, his face the picture of pain as he grimaced through the movement. The entire lift took almost an entire 10 seconds. For the best lifestyle coverage in Australia - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. Impressive as the feat is, Liu is no stranger to breaking world records. In 2023, he set eight Guinness World Records, including the heaviest weighted pull up (109.20 kg), most pull ups in one minute with a 36 kilogram pack (25 pull ups), and the most ring dips in one minute carrying a 45 kilogram pack (20 dips). Contrary to his impressive rep sheet, the strongman did not set out with the intention of setting such records. “Due to the pressures of work and the natural ageing process, I found myself with less energy for fitness than before,” Weiqiang previously told Guinness World Records. “I believed that my training performances were already approaching record levels, so I decided to put myself to the test. “I chose several challenges with a higher chance of success and scheduled them during the beginning of this year’s vacation. “Since starting my job, I’ve had less time for fitness, and I’ve felt a bit slack. However, after proving myself through these records, I find fitness to be relaxing and enjoyable.” Aussies have also gotten a piece of the world record pie as well. In 2023, Brisbane accountant Lucas Helmke went down in history after beating the world record for the most push-ups in one hour as he performed 3206 pushups in 60 minutes. For those having trouble wrapping your head around that figure, that’s an average of 53 per minute. The previous record of 3182 was set by another Aussie, Adelaide mechanic Daniel Scali, in April 2022. Mr Helmke attempted this record to “provide inspiration” for his one-year-old son in a bid to “show him nothing is impossible”. The Queensland man trained for three years to break the record, with the official attempt taking place at powerlifting gym Iron Underground, Brisbane. To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Collapsed Australian fashion label Tigerlily has emerged from a turbulent two-year period to make a dramatic retail comeback just in time for a milestone anniversary. Australian swimwear and apparel brand Tigerlily is set to make its return to Australian shops this Friday, just in time to celebrate its 25th anniversary. After a bumpy two-year period, the brand “all about beach lifestyle” will officially reopen down under. Customers will be able to purchase Tigerlily’s signature bikinis, swimwear, and accessories online and through select retail partners, including department store giant Myer. Tigerlily general manager Prue Slocombe exclusively told NewWire the brand is looking to bring back its “personality” back as it returns. “What we are looking to do with Tigerlily is take it back to that really vibrant, fun personality that it had 10-15 years ago when it was in its prime,” she said. Ms Slocombe said success for the brand will be built on having a customer first approach and staying authentic to customers. “From there we would really love to see some aggressive growth. There is absolutely appetite for a considered retail approach. As part of its anniversary celebrations, the brand will be relaunching some of their best-selling heritage prints. “When we looked through the archives, it was like kids in a candy store looking at all the prints, so we will be tapping into that,” she said. Tigerlily believes the key to a successful relaunch will be offering its unique design and quality garments at the right price, as Australians continue to battle through cost of living pressures. “Quality is king,” Ms Slocombe told NewsWire. “You could see a bikini on the beach and you knew it was Tigerlily and not every brand has that. “All our garments have beautifully finished details, metal badging, metal trims, gorgeous hardware, blanket stitching, patchwork prints, that’s what we are known for and the learnings from the past are we need to retain those parts of the brand.” Tigerlily was founded in 2000 by model, fashion designer and television personality Jodhi Meares. Ms Slocombe said the business coming back 25 years after the brand Ms Meares built couldn’t be better timing. “We very luckily came back at the ... 25th anniversary, so having that nice milestone feels like a nice time to relaunch,” she said. “Also boho is trending right now, so combined it feels like the stars have aligned for us.” Ms Slocombe said the Australian fashion industry as a whole is on the rebound following a leaner time during Covid. “There is something nice about being able to celebrate the heritage brands of Australian fashion and they are still in demand,” she said. “It shows if you’re a strong brand that stays true to its customers and knows its space then brands can really stand the test of time. The relaunch follows a turbulent few years for the fashion brand. First launched in 2000 on the shores of Bondi Beach the brand quickly grew before being bought by fellow Australian fashion label Billabong in 2017. Ten years later Tigerlily changed hands again when Crescent Capital Partners bought it out for $60m. Tigerlily faced significant hurdles, ultimately collapsing in March 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic severely impacted the global retail and fashion sectors. In 2021, the business moved to eco-friendly fabrics including organic materials and natural fibres. While the brand briefly restructured post-Covid, it again fell into financial difficulties and ultimately stopped trading in early 2024. Prior to collapsing, Tigerlily operated 10 stores and had 40 wholesale partners in Australia and the US as well as an online presence. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

    "content": "A hundred real chests from 100 real women, yet censorship laws prevent it from being shared online. So, why are we still so afraid of bodies? It shouldn’t be a radical act for people to see their bodies as they are – naked, unfiltered, and uncensored – on social media. Yet, in 2025, Australia’s most “provocative” body-positivity campaign still can’t be shown in mainstream media without blurring or pixelation. Chloe De Winter, co-founder of the Australian intimates label Nala, says her brand’s Fit Guide 2.0 is “part size guide, part protest”. It all started in 2022 with the brand’s original Fit Guide, which featured 35 bare chests to help women and gender-diverse people see themselves represented when shopping for bras. It was groundbreaking at the time, but Ms De Winter was eager to push for even greater representation. “Thirty-five real naked bodies is good, but it wasn’t enough and it didn’t truly reflect the diversity of our customers,” she told news.com.au. “Since launching, we have added over 30 sizes to our range and now offer more than 80 sizes. Our customers would slide into our inbox and tell us they didn’t feel seen.” So, this week, Nala launched Fit Guide 2.0 – a digital “library” of 100 real chests featuring volunteer models spanning AA to K cup. It includes unedited photos of trans and gender-fluid bodies, mastectomies, breastfeeding and pregnancy chests, unique nipples and size variations, augmentations, reductions, and more, many of which mainstream lingerie brands often overlook. “For the first time, you can scroll through 100 real naked bodies and find a chest and boobs that look like yours,” Ms De Winter says proudly. “Then you can see that body (the one that’s just like yours) in Nala bras that are designed specifically for your body type.” Around 80 per cent of people wear the wrong bra size, as traditional tools for finding the right fit are often confusing, outdated, and rarely inclusive. Ms De Winter hopes this new experience will change the game by focusing on representation and real-life context, rather than just typical measurement-only methods. Despite the overwhelmingly positive reception from fans, the campaign couldn’t avoid the digital censorship they have become accustomed to throughout their journey. “Our content being blocked and restricted is just another day at Nala HQ!” she laughs. “It literally happens every single day. Google blocks our landing pages because of the boobs. “Last year, we even created a powerful campaign advocating for breast cancer awareness, and Meta took it down.” Meanwhile, she says they were recently given a “slap on the wrist” by Ad Standards Australia for posting a picture of someone wearing one of their mesh products. “It’s always the same reasons – ‘sexually explicit content’ or ‘adult policy violations’. We’ve even been told by some tech companies to only use photos of small-busted women because big-busted women are more likely to get flagged, even if they’re wearing the same product.” However, all of this pushback hasn’t led Ms De Winter to consider changing the brand’s marketing approach. “We created Nala to celebrate the incredibly diverse bodies of our wonderful community and will never shy away from showcasing them,” she insists. “As a co-founder, it would be easier to pivot, but it just wouldn’t sit right with me. Some things are worth the fight.” Nala actively appeals removal requests, contacts platform representatives, and battles censorship rules on a daily basis, but progress is slow. But they remain determined to continue challenging these bans, which they believe disproportionately target women and marginalised communities. Jaimee Krawitz, CEO and Founder of Hide N Seek, a non-profit organisation dedicated to body positivity, says this campaign couldn’t have come at a better time. “I see first-hand the impact unrealistic and filtered portrayals of bodies have on young Australians,” she tells news.com.au. “When brands that champion real, unedited bodies are censored, it sends a harmful message that only certain bodies are acceptable or appropriate to be seen.” Body-positive marketing isn’t just empowering – it’s essential, she emphasises. “It plays a crucial role in normalising body diversity and fostering healthier relationships with self-image, especially for young people navigating identity, confidence, and mental wellbeing. Censorship of this content, often under vague ‘community guidelines’, perpetuates stigma, shame, and silence, all of which contribute to serious mental health issues like eating disorders.” Ms Krawitz calls on major platforms to “stop policing authenticity” and instead support it. “If we want to protect the mental health of Australians, we need to create space for real, honest, and inclusive representations of all bodies,” she says. “Brands promoting these values are not the problem, they’re part of the solution.” Collapsed Australian fashion label Tigerlily has emerged from a turbulent two-year period to make a dramatic retail comeback just in time for a milestone anniversary.

    "content": "Skims' new $88 face-shaping wrap has sold out worldwide, but is this medieval-looking device promoting harmful beauty standards? OPINION First, it was our waists in 2019 when Skims launched tummy control shapewear. Then in 2022, it was tiny bikinis, with Kim Kardashian, the brand’s founder, telling her customers, “I wanted to take away the anxiety of buying swimwear”. The bottoms were smaller than dental floss. 2023 arrived, and the brand, currently valued at nearly $5 billion, decided women must shun their current breasts in favour of having perkier ones with constantly erect nipples, thanks to their “revolutionary” nipple bra. This year alone, we’ve seen the launch of Skims’ bum-enhancing shorts with actual butt pads to give you that Brazilian Butt Lift look without the surgery. And then just months later, the ‘Ultimate Hip’ shorts launched, which feature foam pads at the hips to give you that cartoon-hourglass silhouette. Now it seems Skims has run out of body parts to mould, lift and enhance, so they’ve turned to … our face. Introducing Skims’ face shapewear Just when you thought your jawline was safe, this week, Skims launched its Seamless Sculpt Face Wrap. It’s no coincidence that the eerie-looking pull-on contraption closely resembles a post-surgery compression garment because it promises to sculpt the cheek, neck, and chin to give you that “snatched” appearance. Yes, the same look that the Kardashians achieved with much more expensive, potentially surgical treatments. But for the comparatively cheap price of $88, this face wrap promises to give you similar results, and all you have to do is wear it every day for the rest of your life! And while you sleep! Because women apparently aren’t ever allowed to rest. According to the Skims website, the product, which is made from the same fabric blend as its snatching bodysuits, is a “must have”. And given that it’s already sold out worldwide, clearly that messaging has worked. Naturally, the internet is flooded with opinions about the product, with camps clearly divided into: “This is what we’ve come to?” and “Actually, low-key love this”. And Skims definitely expected this debate, and dare I say it, planned it. A controversial product is in their DNA. But at what point do we say enough is enough? What are we going to see next? Shapewear for your feet, à la foot binding in Ancient China? Our heads can’t even relax now While it’s funny to joke and brush off these products as dystopian rage-bait, I feel like we actually need to call this out for what it is – Kardashian continuing to capitalise on women’s insecurities and the beauty standards she has been shaping forever. The Skims Instagram account has over six million followers, and Kardashian’s has 350 million, which means there’s a whole lot of women whose perception of beauty might be changed from a single post. Don’t get me wrong. I love a bit of a beauty gimmick, like dunking your face in ice water in the morning for a more ‘awake’ look. It’s relatively harmless, albeit momentarily painful, based in science and most importantly, it’s free. But this goes beyond an innocent wellness trend. When you start charging nearly a hundred dollars for something that looks like a medieval torture device while implying you’ll look snatched like Kim if you buy it, even though you won’t, it doesn’t just feel like a fun beauty trick – it feels harmful. ‘Relentless cycle of perfectionism’ Jaimee Krawitz, founder of the Hide N Seek Foundation, a national initiative aimed at changing the language around body image and eating disorders, tends to agree. “Products like this reinforce the idea that even our faces need ‘fixing’ to be acceptable, feeding into a relentless cycle of self-surveillance and perfectionism,” Ms Krawitz tells news.com.au. “For young people especially, it sends a harmful message that natural features aren’t enough, eroding self-worth and distorting what beauty really means. It’s not just about the product, it’s about the pressure it silently places on those watching.” No lasting change Seriously – is there a single woman on this planet who ever thought, ‘You know what my life is missing? Spanx for my face.’ Cosmetic experts have even said that a tight garment like this will likely only give you a few seconds of a slimmer face, due to reduced puffiness and swelling. But ultimately, things will just revert to how they were before. So while you might look more snatched in a mirror selfie, I worry about what this might do to your lasting confidence. Will you think that you’re not as beautiful without it? Will this become a gateway product making you want to get surgery? But could this somehow be empowering? If you think I’m being dramatic, I get it. I can already hear you typing through the screen: “Let women do what they want!” And I’m a big supporter of that sentiment. I really am. But with this, I fear it’s not really what women want. It’s what they’ve been told they should want. And it’s outdated. The history of facial straps and bandages goes back centuries, most recently in the early 1900s, when beauty salons advertised chin straps to ‘lift’ sagging skin and get rid of double chins. It’s the same concept now, just packaged differently, with Skims giving it a chic twist and adding an Instagram-worthy filter. In 2025, this is just the latest version of a long tradition that tells women they need to compress themselves, look thinner and appear younger. And in a world where it’s normalised to talk about weight loss injections, buccal fat removal, and face taping, it’s easy to feel angry about Skims’ latest release, which seems perfectly timed. Can Kardashian stop trying to cash in on this skinny-obsessed climate and leave our jaws, and faces alone? Our Apps",

    "content": "From who turns up and what actually goes on, to the truth behind those “moaning” complaints. If you think festival season is all about flower crowns and muddy fields, think again. Deep in England’s Lincolnshire countryside, there’s a gathering in the sleepy town of Allington that only those “in the know” dare to visit. Dubbed as “Glastonbury with orgies and Love Island-style beauties,” Swingathon, now in its fifth year, isn’t your typical festival. But speaking to news.com.au’s From the Newsroom podcast, its organiser, Matt Cole, insists it still has elements of a standard festival. “It’s got live music and entertainment, but it’s for people in the lifestyle,” Mr Cole told the podcast. For those not familiar with “the lifestyle”, swinging involves people from all walks of life – LGBTQIA+, queer, couples, and anyone willing to explore non-monogamy. The three-day event held last weekend marked its biggest turnout yet, with nearly 1000 revellers descending on the small town – which was more than the entire local population. But despite its fun ethos, the event drew serious complaints last year from nearby residents who claimed they heard loud, hours-long “moaning” sounds coming from the campgrounds. Mr Cole insists that this was only half true. “Yes, we had (moaning), but the complaints are basically a lie. We are three miles (4.8km) from the nearest village, so if anyone can scream that loud … that’s a scream,” he laughed. He believes that much of the negative press comes from locals disagreeing with the festival’s premise. The event is mainly made up of couples, with a two-person ticket setting you back around $470 AUD and singles around $400. This year, there were around 100 single men and 50-60 single women in attendance. In terms of the age bracket, the average age is 37, which is much younger than many would expect. “The youngest that we let in was 21 and the oldest guy was 69,” he shared. So what actually goes on behind the gates? By day, the festival – which sees people rock up in anything from their birthday suits, lingerie and fancy dress – hosts lots of different events. “We have a UV party, a social night, workshops, live talks, and demonstrations,” Mr Cole explains. But they’re not just standard demonstrations. “Some of them might be like flogging, wax play or rope play,” he says. “Or pole dancing, burlesque classes and massage classes”. There are also hot tubs, sex games, foam parties, and mobile dungeons. Butt plug bingo is one of the more interesting events, which is bingo with a cheeky twist to it (you win the adult-themed toy at the end). In terms of the actual swinging, there are sanctioned tents where people can go if they’re interested in exploring some adult fun. “It’s all controlled,” Mr Cole explains. “There’s group tents, then there’s voyeur tents – all sorts of tents for everybody”. But before you think it’s all debauchery, Mr Cole says that many don’t even go for that reason. Many simply attend for the liberating, body positivity aspect. “They just go to be around like-minded people,” he says. “It’s not what people think. You don’t just turn up and start swinging. A lot of friendships get made, and people leave with so much more confidence than when they started.” They were once sex worker “besties”, but Annie Knight says her former co-star has gone too far, warning Bonnie Blue’s “ship is going down”. Locals are furious after a raunchy event with over 1000 attendees decscended on its town filling the streets with “moaning” sounds. Mark Latham has claimed that ‘everyone’ engages in this sex act at work – but is that true? And is it ever appropriate? Our Apps",

    "content": "It all comes down to one common household appliance. No matter how much red food colouring you add, you always end up with pink buttercream – and, your many attempts to make pitch-black buttercream always end with the kitchen covered in black food dye and sad, grey buttercream. Making vibrant, deeper-coloured buttercreams can be a difficult task: adding too much food colouring alters not only the taste of the buttercream but it can also affect the consistency. As someone whose skin might as well be permanently dyed with food colouring at this point, I’ve experienced a lot of lows when it comes to colouring buttercream – often, I find opting for pastels is just easier. But when Halloween rolls around and a black cake is a must, or your best friend has asked for a red birthday cake, it’s pretty hard to avoid making these deeper, dark colours. So, here’s my little secret to making more vibrant, deeper-hued buttercreams. READ MORE: This is the secret to the silkiest chocolate buttercream you’ll ever have > You can make buttercream icing with condensed milk > It may sound counterintuitive, but melting buttercream in the microwave is the secret to enhancing the colour of it. Once you’ve stirred in a good couple of drops of gel (never liquid) food colouring to your buttercream, (in our example, you can see the buttercream reaches a dusty rose hue with a few drops of red), pop the buttercream in the microwave at 5-10 second intervals till the buttercream starts to soften. Just be careful not to fully melt the buttercream. You’ll instantly notice that the buttercream has deepened in colour. Pop it in the freezer for 5-10 minutes to thicken it up again – then it can be piped and spread over cakes and cupcakes. If you’ve ever decorated cakes in a super-cold environment, you may have noticed how hard it is to apply buttercream smoothly on a cake. The butter hardens quickly and you end up with an icing job that resembles a Picasso painting. So not only does the microwave hack help with colour, but it helps improve the texture too. When buttercream is slightly melted, the air bubbles are removed from the icing, resulting in extra-smooth buttercream that can be applied to a cake in a picture-perfect way (Hello, Insta-worthy cakes IRL). READ MORE: Silkier, tastier, way less sugar: meet the incredible buttercream alternative > Cake decorators like myself often choose Swiss meringue buttercream as their ‘ride or die’ buttercream. With its meringue base that has butter added to it, it tastes much nicer than regular buttercream and is smoother – unlike regular buttercream, which can be grainy from the icing sugar. It has a great consistency for piping and spreading smoothly on cakes. Plus, it’s easy to add flavouring like melted chocolate, and you can even swirl through some jam for a way to pimp up your buttercream.

    "summary": "Achieving vibrant, deeper-colored buttercreams can be challenging as adding too much food coloring can alter the taste and consistency. A simple trick to enhance the color of buttercream is to melt it in the microwave at 5-10 second intervals, allowing for a more intense color without affecting the taste. This method works best with gel food coloring, which can help create rich colors like black or red.",

    "content": "Every year Kmart leaves its customers in a frenzy with a product that seems too good to be true. But one has emerged as Australia’s favourite. Kmart has been a staple of Australian culture for 56 years, and has had many iconic products as part of its offerings. But after polling Australians on their absolute favourites a winner has emerged - the $15 Microwave Toastie Maker. The item was released as part of the brand’s August Living 2024 range, and Kmart superfan Sue Kerr said her followers have not been able to stop talking about it since. “They’ve got a new one out that prints ‘Yum’ onto the sandwich,” she said. The toastie maker just edged out the 50 cent Mega Bubble Wand and the $99 Spot Cleaner in our 25@25 poll, that was voted on by thousands of Aussies. To celebrate the launch of the new news.com.au app, we’re celebrating the people, places and events we’ll never forget from the first quarter of the 21st century by asking for Australia’s view. Our 25@25 series will finally put to bed the debates you’ve been having at the pub and around dinner tables for years – and some that are just too much fun not to include. Ms Kerr weighed in on all the items Australians will always remember. Ms Kerr, who posts under the name @sueshomefinds on Instagram, told news.com.au she loved Kmart because you could always buy things at an affordable price at the budget retailer — and it was always on trend. “You can buy something every season, spending $100 on a couple of pieces such as a couple of cushions and a throw, a vase or a new quilt cover and a lamp, and update a room on a budget,” she said. “It’s just the best.” She said at the moment, she is loving the Riley Wave Lamp, that retails for $29, saying she was “obsessed” and enjoyed the fact in addition to the table version it now came in a floor version. What’s your favourite? Boucle everything Kmart first introduced boucle material items, which is a fabric known for its looped or curled yarn that creates a distinct textured surface, in 2022 with its $99 Sundae Boucle Chair. @kmarthackqueen told her 170,000 Instagram followers at the time to get in quick if they wanted to get the chair, predicting it would sell out quickly. “If you see this beauty and want it, get it straight away, otherwise you might miss out,” she warned in an Instagram post. “I think they might be very popular.” Others agreed, labelling the chair’s $99 price tag, which has since risen to $129, a “bargain”. The material has popped up several times since, capitalising on the trend just eight months later with the release of the $349 Boucle Swivel Chair. It’s also released a bench and an office chair version. Ms Kerr said: “I love the boucle chair with the timber arms. That is so comfortable and such a great price.” $49 Wave Mirror Kmart introduced the Metal Frame Wavy Floor Mirror for $49, as part of its Black Friday range in 2023. It was not the first retailer to have a full length wave mirror as part of its range, but others have a price tag ranging from $199 to a whopping $899 on designer homewares sites. TikTok user @rachael_hamilton said that social media users should take her video as a sign to get the Metal Frame Wavy Floor Mirror – especially if they were put off by the idea of transporting it home in a small car. “I’ve got a little Hyundai i30, and it fit. Was it a squeeze? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes, because this is a f*****g awesome mirror,” she said. “It looks so good.” Ms Kerr said to her “dismay” it was not an item she was able to pick up for her home, saying sometimes when homewares blow up on social they can be hard to find in stores. “It’s like the Arch Cabinet from February 2024. I wanted that so bad and I was going to all the different stores and I finally found one on the floor,” she said. “It was the only one I ever saw — you should have seen me try to wrangle that into a trolley and into my car.” The $99 Spot Cleaner Kmart first introduced the spot cleaner in 2023, and ever since many social media users and fans of the brand have raved about it - with Ms Kerr being among them. She picked it up for her brown couch, which she expected to be “putrid” when she took to it with the $99 item. The video of the transformation, which showed dark grey water after using it, had Ms Kerr jokingly declaring herself a “filthy person” and the clip gained a few million views as a result. “Everyone was gobsmacked. My couch was dark brown, so you can imagine the hidden dirt that was in it. It was insane, the filthy water at the end, it was very satisfying but appalling at the same time. $289 pilates Reformer Kmart introduced the pilates reformer last year, as part of the Black Friday sales. It was quickly a Hunger Games-style situation with hundreds of Aussies hoping to snap it up for themselves. “That went off in the Black Friday sales,” Ms Kerr said. “I’m hoping that they bring that back because that was going like hot cakes. It was really popular.” 50 cent Mega Bubble Wand Last year, Kmart dubbed the 50 cent item its most popular of 2024 with it boasting a five-star rating on its website. “These are the best ones I’ve bought,” said one review. “It goes a long way”. “A whole lot of fun for just 50 cents an item,” added a second. On TikTok, Perth mum blogger @basic_mumma_life called the Bubble Wand the “ultimate mum hack” and says she leaves them in her nappy bag, camping kit and car to help “diffuse any stressful situation”, or “distract when needed”. “My mum even has them at her house,” she laughed. “And we always have the 2L refill of bubble liquid. You can never have enough”. Ms Kerr said she had bought many of the bubble wands over the years, saying there was a family with five children living next door to her and she always included a few in a Christmas basket for them. “They’re insane for 50 cents, they’re so good,” she said. “You go into a store and the entire end of an aisle has bubble wands and then you go back two weeks later and they’re almost all gone. They must sell so many of those.” Freeze Dried Candy Freeze dried candy was a huge hit in the United States and Australians were counting down until they could get their hands on it — and Kmart delivered. Kmart released six items in its freeze dried candy collection in February. It included Sour Worms, Rainbow Bites, Cola Bottles, Strawberries, Bananas and Marshmallow Twists. Each packet retails for $3. Food content creator, @cyansocial said to “forget” the Strawberries and Bananas, but the Rainbow Bites, Cola Bottles and Sour Worms were worth the hype. Fugglers Fugglers are plush toys that are intentionally designed to look ugly, and are particularly known for their standout teeth. Last year, bizarre looking SpongeBob Square Pants and Patrick Star versions of the toys caught the attention of social media. Both had swollen eyes, wide smiles and teeth that took up most of its faces. Social media users couldn’t help but poke a little fun at the SpongeBob Square Pants toys, with one saying; “SpongeBob and Patrick ate a special Krabby patty.” One added: “I can’t deal. My son would probably love them ugly things.” “These are creepy as. Their faces look very human like,” another social media user added. One revealed: “They fart at you when you walk past them in the store and scare me every damn time.” It’s wasn’t the first time the toys have been available at Kmart in Australia, and the toys aren’t just loved by children. Even adults are huge fans of the bizarre creations. TikTok user @saintbrianjames discovered Fugglers were back in stock in 2023 and immediately rushed into his local store to pick some up. He said he showed “restraint” by only picking up three of the toys, and he wasn’t the only one. “I’m embarrassed to admit I currently have 27 fugglers. I’m 29 with no kids, like what hahahahaa,” one person shared. Another said: “I want one so bad but I can never find them.” $39 Digital recorder Everything retro is new again, and Kmart is cashing in on the Y2K technology with the introduction of the Digital Video Recorder. The item retails for $39. The compact camera featured a two-inch LCD screen, offers up to 16x digital zoom, and records in 720p HD — perfect for creating home movies reminiscent of the 90s and early 2000s. It also includes an SD card, which you can insert into your laptop to transfer the files. “Kmart just released little handy cams,” said influencer @cocodevile. “I’m going see if I can find it before anyone else gets it cause I know they’re going be very popular”. Once they found the item, they took it home and gave it a whirl, claiming, “the quality is very bad” but “I like that”. Not just a Kmart superfan?

    "content": "A fed-up mum’s confrontation with her daughter’s alleged bullies has racked up half a million views, but some people think she crossed the line. A fed-up mum, frustrated that her child’s school was seemingly doing nothing to stop her daughter from being cyberbullied, has taken matters into her own hands and decided to confront her child’s alleged bullies herself. An Auckland-based mum of four, shared a video of the confrontation on TikTok, where it has now amassed over 500,000 views. The footage shows the mother walking into a room as an adult woman tells her to “Stop”. She bypasses her, and begins speaking to a girl, while two other adults believed to be teachers stand between them. “Why are you posting my daughter online? Huh?” she asked the young student, who was seated behind one of the teachers and whose face was blurred. One of the teachers tells the mother, “This is not the place,” but she repeats her question to the girl: “Why are you posting my daughter online?” “Do you know how many people die from suicide because of that?” she continues. “Don’t fat shame my daughter online.” When an adult threatens to call the police, the mother encourages them, saying she has “proof” to show that her daughter’s classmates are bullying her online. Meanwhile, the alleged bully remained silent, even as the mother revealed the online insults directed at her daughter included calling her a “fat hippo”. “I have all the screenshots, you sent it to everybody to post,” she claimed. As one of the adults tries to diffuse the situation, the mum warns: “If I have to come back, it won’t be pretty,” before she walks away. While she admitted in the caption that she “should have waited” for parent-teacher night, she said she “couldn’t help” but defend her daughter. “F**k bullying, f**k fat shaming. If you ain’t teaching your kids that bullying is not okay, WTF (are) you doing? And I’d do it again,” the caption read. In the comments, most people praised the mum for dealing with the issue herself. “This is exactly how it should be handled ... Go you mumma!” said one comment with 7000 likes. “We stand with you mama!” another wrote. “That’s the way, stand up against bullying! Parents of bullies – do better,” a third wrote. “Sometimes, parents of bullied children get so fed up that this is how they deal with the situation,” a fourth said. But some said she was just as bad as the bully. “You’re doing the same thing to the poor kid, shocking behaviour as a parent,” claimed one. “It’s so scary how there are people out there advocating for anti-bullying and looking out for victims, but then figure that bullying bullies back is the solution?” someone else said. It in not known which school this occurred at. News.com.au has reached out to the mother for comment. It comes after an Adelaide mum went viral in February for storming her daughter’s classroom and confronting her alleged bully. The footage of the moment shows the woman screaming violent threats at the student. “You want to f***ing go, b***h? You want to f***ing go? You ever f***ing talk to my daughter again,” she yelled as her husband attempts to push her away. “You ever f***ing mess with my daughter again I’ll slit your f***ing throat. I’ll be waiting for you. And that smart little **** over there, yeah, you know what, you’re just jealous because you’re a **** ****. You’re a **** ****.” Police were investigating the matter. The official ranking of Australia’s Top 100 Private Schools has been released, revealing a significant trend.

A social media storm over a cult outdoor gym at Bondi Beach has led to a barrage of ugly threats against Waverley Mayor Will Nemesh. Rangers temporarily removed free weights from Bondi Park Fitness Station in March after Waverley Council received public safety complaints. In July, free weights returned to the gym after council passed a resolution allowing them, with safety measures in place. But media reports suggested weights had been removed because the gym was attracting “too much testosterone” — a claim that the council has rubbished. Fitness trainer Vix Erber described the gym as a male-dominated area. “It’s really just a bro area and full of testosterone and that’s why so many women train in gyms instead – unless you wanted to pick up a bloke, it’s not a space you’d ever consider using,” Ms Erber told The Sydney Morning Herald. A furore then erupted online with Mr Nemesh as the target. News.com.au understands gym users were concerned the council was cracking down on testosterone and men. A council spokesman said the upset on social media was sparked by “false and misleading information”. “Threats have been received by Mayor Will Nemesh, and while non-local trolls appear to be responsible, Council takes the content seriously and has referred it to authorities,” the spokesman said. “Waverley Council has a zero-tolerance policy towards violent or threatening conduct directed at its staff, volunteers and elected officials.” The spokesman reassured gym users that “free weights continue to be available at Waverley Council’s outdoor gym at Bondi Beach”. “Some equipment brought to the space by members of the community was temporarily removed after public safety concerns were flagged, but council worked with all parties to find a balanced and fair solution.” A man has died and another six people are in hospital in a deadly disease outbreak in inner Sydney.

An Australian artist who spends most of their time living in the United States has revealed a hilarious cultural difference — and many Aussies don’t even realise it’s a “weird” tradition. G Flip, who is originally from Melbourne, is largely based in the US and is married to American Selling Sunset star Chrishell Stause. The Disco Cowboy singer, who uses they/them pronouns, and the reality TV star recently celebrated their third marriage ceremony together. During their time together, the couple has discovered some crazy cultural differences between Australia and the United States. “I’m an Aussie who lives in America and I have an American wife and I think one of the funniest things to explain about Australian culture is that you can win a meat tray in the pub,” the singer and drummer said. “So you go to the pub and they hand out raffle tickets to win a meat tray. And you just win a tray of various meats and sausages. “You go home with the meat tray. And everyone who’s American that I’ve ever told that to is like, ‘What the f***.” G Flip said the first time Stause came to Australia, they took her to a pub in Darwin and they didn’t win the meat tray. The musician asked if anywhere else in the world had a similar practice. Aussies quickly weighed in on the iconic tradition. “It’s also compulsory to say to winners ‘barby at yours tomorrow!’ whether you know them or not,” one person declared. Another said: “I wouldn’t say this is everywhere in Canada but where I live some bars/pubs have what we call Porchetta Bingo and if you win you get a basket full of Porchetta. Pairs perfect with cold beer.” Someone else commented: “Texas does meat raffles. I’ve always thought it was very strange.” “And I’m a vegetarian but I’m buying a ticket every time,” one social media user commented. One said: “I was at a pub on Monday and the raffle didn’t have a meat tray and I was so confused! No Sussan I don’t want $20 I want meat!” “Even funnier when you have to carry it around for the rest of the night/pub crawl and get random photos taken with the meat tray being carried by different people all night,” another said. One commented: “The sadness when you leave it behind the bar in the fridge while you’re there, and then forget to pick it up before you leave.” “And, the stakes are higher at Christmas time with legs of ham,” one said. Another commented: “As an Aussie, I never realised this was weird hahahaha.” Even Stause herself commented on her wife’s clip, writing: “Even though I know it will give me meat sweats and likely food poisoning, I still want to win one.” Australia Post faces mounting criticism after a resident's desperate attempt to receive their parcel exposes widespread delivery failures.

    "content": "Gasps were heard after five professional hockey players learned their fate in court after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman. Five Canadian professional hockey players accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2018 were found not guilty on Thursday, with the judge ruling the complainant’s account of the alleged offences was not credible. The case had captured the country’s attention, and raised concern about broader issues in the culture of hockey, Canada’s cherished national sport. Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, Carter Hart and Callan Foote stood trial on charges they assaulted the woman in a hotel room in London, Ontario in Canada following a national men’s junior team celebration. All denied wrongdoing, claiming the woman — whose identity is protected — was an active and willing participant in a series of sex acts. Roughly 100 protesters supporting the woman were outside the court when the day began but were gone when court adjourned. The complainant’s lawyer, Karen Bellehumeur, called the verdict “devastating.” Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia read out her detailed decision in front of a packed London court, following one of the most closely watched trials in recent Canadian history. She opened the hearing by declaring that she did “not find the evidence of (the complainant) to be either credible or reliable,” and that prosecutors had failed to prove their case. Those declarations prompted gasps in the courtroom and embraces among the families of the accused, public broadcaster CBC reported. Some five hours later, Carroccia announced not guilty verdicts for each of the defendants. “I find as a fact that the complainant did express that she wanted to engage in sexual activity with the men,” she said. She ruled there was insufficient evidence to determine the consent expressed by the complainant “was vitiated by fear.” Criminal trials in Canada are often decided by a jury, but the case shifted to a judge-only trial after two juries were dismissed. Multiple investigations The complainant, 20 at the time, met McLeod at a bar in London before having sex with him. That initial encounter was not at issue in the trial, which focused on events that occurred after McLeod messaged a team-wide group chat asking if anyone was interested in a “three-way.” The court heard the woman engaged in multiple sex acts with the players over a number of hours. Prosecutors argued the players failed to take steps to ensure her consent. Defence lawyers said the woman willingly participated and only made the assault allegations after regretting her choices. In her reasoning for the verdict, the judge said there were “troubling aspects” to how the complainant recalled the events. Carroccia noted the woman said she was speaking “her truth,” not the truth, “which seemingly blurs the line between what she believes to be true and what is objectively true.” Bellehumeur said her client faced “insulting, unfair, mocking and disrespectful” treatment from the defence over several days of withering cross-examination. An initial police investigation into the allegations produced no charges. Subsequent media probes revealed Hockey Canada, a governing body, used funds from subscription fees paid by ordinary families for a $3.55 million CAD (A$3.95) out-of-court settlement with the woman, forcing the resignation of Hockey Canada’s leadership. Amid public uproar, London police re-opened the case and brought charges against the players last year. Formenton’s lawyer, Daniel Brown, told reporters after the verdict that London police “got it right seven years ago.” “Political and media pressure brought this allegation back into the spotlight,” Brown said, accusing prosecutors of “forging ahead with a hopeless prosecution.” Court proceedings focused on the evolving legal definitions of consent, and the trial addressed videos made by McLeod of the complainant saying she was OK with what happened. Prosecutors argued the decision to make a video indicated concern the sex was not consensual. Hart, a former National Hockey League goaltender, testified such videos were common practice among professional athletes. Carroccia made clear she did not assess the videos as evidence of consent, but found they shed light on the woman’s state of mind. “She was speaking normally. She was smiling. She did not appear to be upset or in distress,” the judge said. US President Donald Trump has taken an eye-opening threat to new heights as he doubled down on his stance for a major change. A young couple have been caught engaging in an apparent sex act during a sporting contest, much to the distress of fellow fans. WARNING: Explicit content.

    "content": "Liam Paro has sacrificed his chance at super-lightweight glory to pursue blockbuster fights, putting him on track to becoming Australia’s next boxing pay-per-view star. Liam Paro will give up his IBF super-lightweight world title eliminator fight with Mexico’s Lindolfo Delgado and move up to welterweight. After making the 140-pound (63.5kg) limit for 10 straight years, Code Sports understands the Queenslander is now struggling to make the weight class and will move up a division. Paro is ranked fifth at super-lightweight with The Ring, and is in the top five with the WBO, IBF and WBC. The move to 147 pounds (66.7kg) means he won’t join Kostya Tszyu in becoming a two-time super-lightweight world champion, but opens up the possibility of big-money bouts against the likes of Rolando ‘Rolly’ Romero, Brian Norman Jr and Ryan Garcia. The other big names in the mix are WBC welterweight world champion Mario Barrios, who held onto his title with a draw against the great Manny Pacquiao in the headline fight of Tim Tszyu’s loss to Sebastian Fundora in Las Vegas. Paro has even spoken about one day facing modern day great Pacquiao at some stage, telling Fox Sports, “I’d love that fight. “Manny, he’s one of my favourite fighters. And to have his name on my resume would be something special.” The move up to one of boxing’s glamour divisions is in line with turning ‘The Prodigy’ into Australia’s next PPV boxing star, alongside Tim and Nikita Tszyu. A Cowboys diehard, there have even been preliminary talks of having Paro fight in Las Vegas on the same weekend that North Queensland play Newcastle in the 2026 season opener in Sin City. Paro most recently scored a thunderous fifth round stoppage win over Johnathan Navarro in his Australian homecoming in Cairns in June. That bout was his first on home soil since his first round knockout of Brock Jarvis in Brisbane in 2022. Since then, the 29-year-old knocked out the highly touted Montana Love before scoring one of the biggest boilovers of 2024 with a unanimous decision world title win over Subriel Matias. He relinquished the IBF world title in a split decision defeat to slick American Richardson Hitchens in December before his Far North Queensland homecoming in June. Paro had been linked to super-lightweight bouts with Isaac ‘Pitbull’ Cruz, Romero and Delgado, but his team is understood to see more of a future at welterweight. Paro has been loosely pencilled in to fight again in September.

Hawthorn legend Shane Crawford was left fighting back tears as he spoke about his younger brother’s suicide. Justin died in 2022 at the age of 45 in a moment that left the entire Crawford family heartbroken.

As he looks to shine a light on mental health struggles, the 305-game player spoke about the struggles he has endured since losing his brother. “It’s just like a wild storm that’s just thrown into your face and you just don’t know how to sort of move through it,” Crawford told Mike Amor on 7News. “When I heard the news from my mother, and it took a full day for my mother to communicate with me. “You have days where...,” he says before pausing as the emotion hits. “... where you look for answers and they’re not there.” The two brothers shared their childhood dream of running out for an AFL game together when Justin joined Shane at Hawthorn in 1997. Those memories are ones Shane often reflects on and says he has a simple message if his brother was still around. “I was very proud of him and probably needed to tell him more,” he said. “I’d tell him he’s always been loved and cherished and to grow into an old man.” Shane said Justin had left notes behind explaining everything that he was going through. “We were lucky because we had a few little notes that were left and, it doesn’t make it easier, probably not, but there were a few things there that explained a little bit about how he was feeling and a little of him explaining how much loved and thanked everyone for helping. “He adored his son and it was such an unbelievable relationship, to know he didn’t feel worthy enough to be around for that. He was obviously well and truly over the cliff.” Justin played four seasons in the AFL after being selected by the Swans before the 1994 AFL Draft, he went on to tally a total of 46 games for the Swans and Hawks were he kicked a total of 32 goals. After two seasons with Sydney and two with Hawthorn, Justin called time on his AFL career and walked away from the game at the age of only 21. To join the conversation, please log in.

Josh Giddey and the Bulls still remain far apart in talks on a new deal to keep the Australian in Chicago, although a recent survey of rival NBA front offices has offered a glimpse into what the market could have looked like for the 22-year-old guard. Watch live coverage of NBL 2025-26 season with ESPN on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1. While it was widely expected at first that Giddey and the Bulls would come to an agreement, and there haven’t been any indications that still won’t eventually happen, the two sides remain far apart on price. The Chicago Sun Times reported on Tuesday morning that figure is “somewhere between $8 million and $10 million per year”, having previously claimed that Giddey is after “Jalen Suggs-like extension that would pay him $30 million a season”. The Times went on to report that the Bulls “took the prove-it stance” and for now, Giddey and his camp has done just that. In fairness, both sides are incentivised to be patient but the Bulls in particular are in a position of power given there isn’t a market for Giddey. That is because there aren’t really any teams with the necessary cap space to sign him for close to that $30 million a season figure, and even if there are they don’t have a genuine need at the point guard position. But if rival teams did have the money to sign him? Well, it sounds like for the most part Giddey would still be looking at closer to that lower range of $20 million based on reporting from The Athletic. The publication recently polled 16 people working in NBA front offices, including no one from the Bulls, to see what they thought a “fair” contract would be for Giddey. This, however, was as much about what they thought Giddey deserved to be paid as how many years he should be signed, because as the article noted long-term contracts are growing increasingly rare with teams wanting more roster flexibility. Giddey’s mean average yearly value in the poll was $22.3 million a year, with the overwhelming majority (14 of 16) responding with an average annual salary between $20 million and $25 million. The lowest valuation of Giddey came from one front-office staffer who admitted to not being a fan of the Australian’s game, putting forward $50 million over four years, which comes out to just $12.5 million a year. The largest hypothetical contract offer from one respondent was five years and $125 million, although that still comes out lower than the $30 million per year Giddey is reportedly after. That $25 million mark, however, was the most common response with seven participants suggesting it. Four- and five-year contracts are becoming increasingly rare. But can Josh Giddey buck the trend?I polled 16 people from NBA front offices, asking them what they would deem a fair contract for Giddey. Results in here.Story with @JoelXLorenzi: https://t.co/HMZHpJOsGYpic.twitter.com/0XufFqMfZT As for the number of years, seven responded with four while three suggested five-year contracts. “If you’re offering a four-year contract, you have to be correct,” one executive told The Athletic. “But Giddey, you could offer a four-year deal,” the executive added, calling Giddey the “anomaly” to the NBA trend of shorter contracts “because he might be good enough to be a four-year player”. Giddey is coming off a promising first year with the Bulls where he averaged 14.6 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.2 assists, although those numbers were significantly improved across the board after the All-Star break (21.2 points, 10.7 rebounds and 9.3 assists).

    "content": "Brisbane Roar will get an early indication of the progress made under new coach Michael Valkanis in Sunday’s trial against Auckland FC. Brisbane Roar star Jay O’Shea says an early pre-season test against Auckland FC is just what his hungry teams needs in the absence of competitive Australia Cup games. For the second year in succession, the Roar failed to qualify for the Australia Cup after again losing in playoffs involving the bottom four A-League teams from the previous season. O’Shea said the absence of competitive matches, particularly against top-flight opposition, hurt the Roar in the build-up to the club’s miserable 2024-25 A-League campaign. “We didn’t play against any A-League opposition before the season started, so it was hard to gauge where we were at,” the Irish midfielder said. “We probably got caught cold going into the season.” Eager to avoid a similar scenario ahead of the club’s 2025-26 season, Roar officials took advantage of Auckland being in Queensland this week for an Australia Cup round-of-32 clash against Gold Coast Knights to organise a meeting with the reigning Premier’s Plate winners on Sunday at Imperial Corp Stadium, the home of NPL outfit Brisbane City. “It’ll be a good game to see where we’re at, coming up against last season’s premiers. It’ll be a good test for us,” said O’Shea, who added that there was a “good feeling” at the club under new coach Michael Valkanis. “It’s been really good. We’ve got some new faces in the door who look really impressive, and I don’t think we’re done yet. The club will still be bringing a few more players in.” New Roar signings expected to be involved on Sunday include goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis, Kiwi left-back James McGarry, former Swiss and Bosnian youth international midfielder Milorad Stajic, and attackers Michael Ruhs and Justin Vidic. Another of Brisbane’s new faces, English striker Chris Long, won’t be involved as he doesn’t arrive in Queensland until Sunday night. Auckland is in good form heading into the contest after reaching the Cup round-of-16 with a midweek 4-0 win over the Knights. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

Injured England captain Ben Stokes insists that he does not regret his actions from the final day handshake drama during the drawn fourth Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Old Trafford. Stokes, who will sit out the series finale starting Thursday with a right shoulder injury, offered the draw to Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar at the drinks break in the final session of day five in Manchester, but spat the dummy when the pair of all-rounders refused to shake Stokes’ hand. ï»¿Watch England vs India Test Series LIVE & EXCLUSIVE on Fox Cricket, available on Kayo Sports | New to Kayo? Join now and get your first month for just $1.ï»¿ India were four wickets down and led by 71 runs at the time with both Jadeja and Washington closing on centuries - a first in Test cricket for the latter - and Stokes was furious that the two batters wanted to push on to their personal milestones. In an already feisty series, Stokes poured more fuel on the fire by telling Jadeja: “You’re going to get a Test hundred against Harry Brook and Ben Duckett”. He then refused to continue using his front line bowlers and instead allowed Brook to lob up pies in what was an embarrassing end to the Test match. But Stokes says he does not regret how the situation unfolded, nor how he handled it, despite gaining greater perspective on India’s viewpoint. “I don’t have regrets, but it is one of those when you have not been in the field for 250 overs, you do have a bit more of an understanding towards both sides,” Stokes said. “Two lads in Jadeja and Washington played incredibly well up until that point, so you sort of understand as to why as they wanted to stay out there and get their 100s. “But as I said at the end of the game, fair enough but I am not going to bowl my bowlers in a situation where we can’t win the game. “We are over it, I think India are over that whole thing. “Let’s just try our best not to focus on a 20-minute period of cricket when it has been such a great series so far.” The incident was the latest in an ever-growing list throughout the five-Test series which England leads 2-1. Tempers flared in the days leading up to The Oval finale when Indian coach Gautam Gambhir had a run in with head curator Lee Fortis over not being allowed to inspect the pitch up close, and a cool box being put on the square as India practised. Things also got hot under the collar during the third Test at Lords as India did not take kindly to England’s time wasting tactics when they managed to face only one over late on day three despite having to bat for seven minutes. Stokes’ opposite number Shubman Gill, who has been a revelation with the bat since being handed the captaincy making four centuries in the series, was certain in his pre-match press conference that both teams were able to leave the on field spats behind them. “I think I have already explained what happened at Lord’s and about even the incident that happened on the last day in the previous Test,” Gill said. “Both the teams have been very competitive. And sometimes when you are competitive, you know, in the heat of the moment, you do or say things that you might not do (otherwise). “But I think once the match is over, there is mutual respect between both the teams.” Stokes shared similar sentiments, saying that “it has been a tough series, but it has been class to play in”. “It has been a test of characters, a test of physicality, all that kind of stuff, and I think the way each team has fronted up every single day and every single session giving everything for their countries is testament to how much this format means to England and India and every other team in the world,” he added. “The easy option would just be to not turn up and give up, but you have seen both teams turn up every day, give everything, and leave everything out on the field. “I don’t think it will be any different this week.” Stokes is set to be sidelined for six to seven weeks as a result of his shoulder issue, and he is one of four changes to the England XI for the fifth Test. Highly touted 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, who batted at number three during their tour of New Zealand late last year despite never having scored a professional century, will take Stokes’ place at number six. Bethell will also take on the all-rounder duties as a spin option alongside Joe Root with fellow left arm spinner Liam Dawson discarded after playing at Old Trafford following an eight-year hiatus from the Test side. Fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse also make way with Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton all coming into the side to form a four-man pace attack alongside Chris Woakes. Ollie Pope will take on captaincy duties in Stokes absence, as he did for the home series against Sri Lanka and for the first Test of the Pakistan last year. “We have got some incredible leaders out in that 11 still,” Stokes said. “I know I am captain, but I seek advice from quite a few people, and we have got some fantastic cricket brains out there. “We have got a team of 11 match-winners; one person doesn’t win you a game. “Just because I am playing or not, it doesn’t mean we are going to win or lose. “We have had some people put in some special individual performances throughout this series and this is another opportunity for 11 people to be able to put their hand up and hopefully win a game for England as well.” India on the other hand are set to be without superstar fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah as part of the management of his troublesome pack. Entertaining wicket keeper batter Rishabh Pant will also be sidelined with the foot injury he sustained while batting in Manchester, but the final make up of India’s XI remains uncertain.

Loveable AFL icon Billy Brownless is set to make a shock return to TV screens when he picks up the microphone for Channel 7 next month. Brownless will line up in the commentary booth alongside several greats of the game for the Victoria vs All Stars Legends Game on August 28.

Join now and get your first month for just $1. The 58-year-old Geelong cult hero will join Hawks icon Robert ‘Dipper’ DiPierdomenico, Brian Taylor, Matthew Richardson, Rebecca Maddern and Andy Maher in calling the iconic contest. The appearance for Brownless on the rival network comes after his long-running stint with Channel 9’s Footy Show ended in 2021. Since departing the screen, Brownless has made sporadic appearances on the Sunday Footy Show but has mainly kept to radio with his Triple M show The Rush Hour with JB & Billy. Brownless will be on hand for the match which has been rebranded as the Legends Game for Prostate Cancer and marks 30 years since footy legend E.J. Whitten passed away from the disease. The contest is set to feature a handful of returning superstars with Gary Ablett Jr, Cyril Rioli, Nick Riewoldt, Luke Hodge and Brendan Fevola all set to pull on the boots. Brownless’ return to the commentary booth comes after he left his family horrified last month by posting a photo of himself skinny dipping on social media. In the midst of a mid-year getaway with partner Crystle Fleur in Western Australia, the Geelong icon decided to share some happy snaps from the trip. But it was one image from a swimming pool in Broome that stole the show. The image showed him relaxing in the pool with his obvious lack of swimwear leaving little to the imagination — thankfully he was facing away from the camera. “Some call it ‘Skinny Dipping’ I like to call it ‘Fat Dipping’ #fatstraveldiary,” he wrote. Safe to say the X-rated post was a bit of a surprise to Brownless’ friends and family. Former AFL star Dale Thomas joked: “Reverse angle is a Nirvana album cover.” Bec Judd commented: “Ahahaha. Nice seeing you yesterday. Glad you had some clothes on.” Brownless’ horrified daughter Ruby commented: “Wow it gets worse”, after responding to his swimming pool post with “Honestly no words”. Brownless told the Herald Sun his partner had uploaded the viral skinny dip photo to his Instagram account without his knowledge. “She thought it was fun. I was just paddling around in the pool, splashing around,” he said. “She said I’ve got a shot here for you. Darl, we’ll get rid of those shorts and we’ll just have a bit of fun with it. And she thought it would be funny to go nude. She knows how to post off my account. 120,000 views, the punters loved it.” The Cats Hall of Famer said his kids let him know they were less than impressed. “They’re the ones who aren’t so happy,’’ Brownless said. “Ruby is the most outspoken, she rang me.

    "content": "Nikita Tszyu has slammed critics of his brother Tim's Las Vegas defeat, revealing the truth about how the fight ended – while defending the family's boxing legacy. Nikita Tszyu has hit out at “ignorant” fans and a “f***ed up” boxing world while slamming commentary around his older brother Tim “quitting” on his stool against Sebastian Fundora. Meanwhile, longtime Tszyu family rival Michael Zerafa – who fights on the same August pay-per-view card as Nikita – claims ‘The Butcher’ is actually a better fighter than his older brother. Nikita returns to action for the first time in a year against German-based Macedonian Lulzim Ismaili (12-0) on August 20 at the ICC Theatre in Sydney, and was ringside as Tim was beaten by a much-improved Fundora at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. After a week of speculation, Nikita says it was trainer and uncle, Igor Goloubev, who stopped the fight after the seventh round. “Tim just didn’t have anything left in him and the corner stopped it,” Nikita told Code Sports. “They visually saw that he was out, and that he no longer had the strength. “Igor stopped it. My uncle stopped it. I’m 99% sure of that.” That hasn’t stopped a wave of online criticism being aimed at Tim, with many fans and pundits saying he quit on his stool, despite saying just days earlier that he was willing to die in the ring. “I’ve been seeing a lot of ‘quit, quit, quit,’ but it wasn’t the case,” Nikita said. “It was done. It was a losing battle. “It’s just a bit of ignorance and it’s a shame that it happens. It’s a shame that we’re so flawed as a society that everyone has to play the blame game. “There’s no dishonour in that fight. “Tim fought his ass off, did everything he could and wasn’t able to finish the job. He got beat. There’s no dishonour in that. “Why’s everyone slamming him? It’s kind’ve fucked up. “Do you expect him to die on his feet? The boxing world is messed up.” Hall of Famer Jeff Fenech was one of many to slam Tim’s corner in the days after the fight, and urged the Sydneysider to make changes to his team. Nikita brushed off those criticisms and will use the same personnel, including Goloubev, cutman Mark Gambin and trainer Dave Barker, on August 20. “I’ll always use them,” he said. “I feel most comfortable with them, and if there’s anyone I’d want to lose with, it’s them. “My mentality is just different than most boxers. I don’t think there’s dishonour in losing. You go into a fight, you prepare your best. “If you don’t prepare, that’s the most dishonourable thing you can do. We always come in as prepared as possible. “If we win, we win. If we lose we lose, but we always fight our ass off. “The UFC is the perfect example of how it should be. People fight, they win, they lose, everyone gets praised. “In boxing, everyone just gets slammed. It’s a weird dynamic.” Nikita has been out of action since his August 2024 Fight of the Year win over Koen Mazoudier. Since then, ‘The Butcher’ has battled with a hand injury, got married and had his first child, a daughter named Curiosity. Lulzim will be his first international opponent, and there are plans for Nikita to face Zerafa later this year. He wouldn’t talk about a potential fight with Zerafa, who fights American Mikey Dahlman (18-1) in the co-main event on August 20, while ‘The Pretty Boy’ says he’s now focused on landing a big-money fight with the older Tszyu brother. He even claims Nikita is better than Tim. “The grudge match isn’t with Nikita, it’s with me and Tim,” Zerafa said of his years-long rivalry with Tim. “Nikita’s still young in his career, I’m ranked higher than him, and now, higher than Tim. “He’s crafty and strong, and I actually think he’s a better fighter than Tim. “He’s still raw, he’s still fresh in the sport, but he’s doing great things. He’s a weird personality – he’s the weird guy, I’m the bad guy. “But it’s one fight at a time. That’s Nikita’s thing, so keep doing it.” The August 20 undercard also sees the return of Sydneysider Brock Jarvis against Sam Beck (7-0) for his first bout since his defeat to Keith Thurman in March. Rising Sydney superstar Ahmad Reda is on the hunt for a new opponent after Brisbane power puncher Billy Polkinghorn was forced out through injury. Further down the card, heavyweight slugger Brandon Grach is in a five-rounder, while Jasmine Parr and Isaias Sette will also feature.

Australia’s Kaden Groves has completed his set of grand tour stage wins after thriving on the slippery roads to Pontarlier on the penultimate day of the Tour de France. The Gympie-born 26-year-old sprinter is normally renowned for fast finishes, but excelled in the tough and wet slog over the hills to claim an emotional victory from a 13-man breakaway. The Alpecin-Deceuninck rider surged ahead 16km from home and held on for his first Tour stage win and 10th at major races. Groves has claimed two bunch sprint stages at the Giro d’Italia and seven at the Spanish Vuelta. “Today we weren’t sure whether to go for the stage or wait for tomorrow but when the rain falls I have a super feeling normally in the cold weather,” an emotional Groves said. “There’s so much pressure at the Tour, and having won in the Giro, having won in the Vuelta, all I ever get asked is am I good enough to win in the Tour? And now I shown them. “It’s my first time winning, so it’s pretty incredible.” In yet another reason for Groves to celebrate, he claimed Alpecin-Deceuninck’s third win in the Tour de France, adding to their success. It is also a considerable boost to team morale as well, given that the team’s other stage winners, Jasper Philipsen and Mathieu van der Poel, had to abandon due to injury and illness, respectively. “I’m incredibly happy and proud of this team,” Groves said. “We had a great start, winning two stages and a number of days in yellow, but we had a number of super low points, too, losing Jasper and Mathieu, so it’s been quite a roller coaster for the team.” “On a personal note, I knew I hadn’t been sprinting super well. But in the end of a third week of a Grand Tour, I have been handling mountains well.” Runaway overall race leader Tadej Pogacar maintained his lead over Danish rival Jonas Vingegaard ahead of the final stage in Paris. The Team UAE rider has a 4min 24sec advantage heading into what could be a tricky finale, a 132km ride from Mantes-la-Ville to the Champs-Elysees, but featuring three ascents of the cobbled streets of Montmartre. “It’s starting to sink in,” said the 26-year-old, who previously won the sport’s most prestigious cycling stage race in 2020, 2021 and 2024. “Tomorrow, all being well, I’ll be celebrating with my team. This has been another level of hard, all the way. I enjoyed it though and I’m really looking forward to the last day tomorrow.” Originally published as Queensland’s Kaden Groves wins his first Tour def France stage To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "After Oscar Piastri’s victory at the Belgian GP, a Formula 1 veteran has dropped his verdict for the fierce world title showdown. F1 commentator Martin Brundle has belatedly praised Oscar Piastri for his latest Grand Prix victory and made a call on the 2025 world title battle. Starting from second on the grid, Piastri won the Belgian Grand Prix ahead of McLaren teammate and title rival Lando Norris, with the Aussie extending his championship lead to 16 points.

Join now and get your first month for just $1. Many fans were left fuming, however, as the Sky Sports broadcast once again focused predominantly on Englishman Norris, rather than his race-winning stable mate. With Norris making a series of crucial errors in the closing stages as he attempted to catch Piastri, Brundle instead highlighted his compatriot’s “brilliant charge” on the broadcast. Perhaps the criticism that rained down upon him was fresh on 66-year-old Brundle’s mind when he penned a post-Spa opinion piece for the Sky Sports website. Brundle, who picked up nine podiums in his 12-year career in the premier category, ultimately had some lofty comparisons when assessing Piastri’s drive in Belgium. “It was a champion’s drive from Oscar Piastri in the main race on Sunday at Spa,” he wrote. “The kind of performance reminiscent of the likes of Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, and Max Verstappen in this modern era. “A small error at Stavelot cost him pole position to teammate Lando Norris, who had impressively homed in on peak performance overnight. Never miss the latest sports news from Australia and around the world - download the news.com.au app direct to your phone. “But then Piastri read and stalked his championship rival from the eventual rolling start, exited turn one La Source more cleanly, followed closely through Eau Rouge and Radillion, and kept momentum to sweep past into a lead he would not relinquish. “This also gave him the all-important pit stop priority between the two.” Horrendous conditions delayed the start of the race on Sunday, with it finally getting underway behind a safety car. While Piastri jumped his teammate and grabbed the lead in the early stages, Norris was on the better compound tyre for a one-stop strategy. It left the Aussie with a huge fight on his hands to retain the lead, particularly in the closing stages. Brundle had high praise for the Victorian’s effort, stating he “made it look easy”. “Because we waited so unnecessarily long to get underway, the race was much drier than expected, and this meant managing intermediate tyres through their compound destruction phase into a tread-less bald contact patch,” Brundle continued. “The other McLaren side of the garage cleverly agreed with Norris to opt for the hard dry compound tyre, after Piastri’s medium compounds were already fitted the previous lap, which meant Lando wouldn’t have to pit again. “Piastri then had to completely reset and coax his tyres for the remaining 70 per cent of the race, which he did with utter calmness and without error despite Norris coming back at him with increasing chunks each lap. “Basically, he needed to deploy all the driving tools in the toolbox on the day and made it look easy. “Lando was unlucky with having to go an extra lap on the intermediates because they were too close to do a double stack pit stop and then to compound that his stop was slow. “As he said in the cooldown room post-race, ‘I just thought bye-bye Oscar’.” Norris threw away any chance at victory due to those three costly mistakes as Piastri oozed class and kept his cool. As Norris began to close the gap to Piastri, he ran wide at turn 10 and lost more than a second before losing another half a second thanks to a big lockup. With only three laps to go and the margin down to three seconds, Norris once again locked up at turn one and saw the margin blow back out to 4.7 seconds. Those miscalculations ultimately allowed the Aussie to hold off his teammate and secure his sixth win of the season. But fans were left furious at the commentary, which seemed to downplay the Aussie’s masterclass and instead hinted Norris was somewhat unlucky not to win. Piastri’s win was put down to “superior race management”, while Norris’ fate was sealed by “unfortunate miscalculations”. Fans vented their feelings towards the commentary online. “Insufferable dribble coming from Crofty. Piastri, no mistakes on higher degrading tyres with something left in the tank at the end not mentioned at all. Let’s talk about his race management skills, which are superior to Lando’s. The bias of Crofty is oozing out of him,” one fan wrote. “As an Aussie, the absolutely anti-Piastri commentary from Sky Sports has been disgraceful. Brundle and Crofty normally love listening to both of you every race, but today’s obsession with Lando was incredibly biased, English or not,” another said. “Tell Crofty his sh** British Lando bias is getting out of hand! Lando is making mistakes left, right and centre and Croft still has him winning! Even after Oscar crossed the line and won, Croft was STILL crapping on about Norris. It’s time for him to go,” a third added. Brundle noted those errors again when stating his belief – and hopes – for the remainder of the season. “Once again in certain phases we saw the McLarens a second or two clear of the field every lap,” he wrote. “Lando threw caution to the wind, he had nothing to lose, and he had to somehow disturb Oscar’s tyre economy run, but three errors we saw on TV meant he came up short and had to settle for second and a further loss of eight points. “I’ve felt the same way all year, when all the stars align I believe Lando is marginally the faster, but Oscar is more consistent, makes fewer errors, and is more clinical in combat. “And his head is always rock solid. He’ll take some beating in the closing stages now. “Lando will need absolutely all he’s got, all the time, to win this. “We’ve very often seen two championship combatants find an overdrive and move to a scarcely believable level of delivery, it will be interesting to see if that happens over the next three Sprints and 10 GPs.” The Formula 1 season moves to the Hungaroring circuit this weekend for the Hungarian Grand Prix and the only place to see every F1 race live is on Kayo Sports and Foxtel.

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have had one of the cleanest and most cordial world title scraps in a long time, but there are some things where the F1 championship contenders are divided. Heading into this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix, Piastri made the blunt statement all fans have thought for a long time — that the 2025 drivers’ championship is now a head-to-head battle between the McLaren pair. However, Norris on Thursday voiced his disagreement to the idea that four-time world champ Max Verstappen is out of contention.

The Red Bull ace, who on Friday morning announced he will stay with the energy drink operation through to the end of the 2026 series, has also all-but waived the white flag. Verstappen has fallen 81 points behind series leader Piastri. Red Bull are in a state of flux, after sacking their team principal Christian Horner this month and replacing the Briton with Laurent Mekies, the boss of their ‘B’ team Racing Bulls. Despite this, Norris says a line can’t be put through the Dutch driver’s name yet. As reported by Racing News 365, Norris said he wouldn’t rule Verstappen out. “It’s never impossible,” Norris said. “We proved that last year, but he’s quite a long way back.” The British racer went on to say: “We have a team that’s a lot more stable and performing a lot better than Red Bull is, but Max is still, quite easily, one of the best drivers ever in Formula 1. “So, as a driver, I wouldn’t rule him out, but we have a better car, we have a better team, so I have my confidence in them that we can, we can stay ahead.” Piastri earlier called it like he saw it. “I suppose so,” he said when asked if it was a “two-horse” race for the title, per planetf1.com. “I think every weekend now, or the last few weekends anyway, it’s been Lando and I. “I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year, but whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, maybe, we never really know. “So, I’m not too concerned about what happens in that. I’m just trying to win each race and extend the lead. “But I think clearly Lando and I are in the same car, which is the best, and he’s naturally going to be the closest competition.” McLaren boss Zak Brown this week insisted the team won’t be playing favourites and that the championship race will be a “coin toss” between his two drivers. Piastri has had the upper hand on Norris for the majority of the season, having won six of the first 13 races. The 24-year-old from Melbourne holds a 16-point advantage over his 25-year-old teammate. With McLaren on track to secure their first drivers’ championship since 2008, Brown is leaving the championship door open and refusing to back just one of the two. “I think Oscar was a little disappointed with qualifying in Belgium. Lando was very happy. I’m sure he’ll be a little bummed that he didn’t win today, but it’s coming off two wins. I think it’s going to be a coin toss every weekend,” he told Sky Sport following the Belgian Grand Prix. “Oscar is a machine. And what’s impressive is how aggressive he is, and yet he always brings the car home. That’s quite a talent.” Brown also said Verstappen could not be ruled out yet. Red Bull is reportedly running an upgraded package this weekend. “I think it’s too early. It’s looking good, but Max … there’s a lot of racing left to go. We’ve got a nice gap, but I wouldn’t say we’re there,” he said. “We’ve all been around this sport too long. To start dancing before you’re in the end zone is a very dangerous thing to do.” The Hungarian Grand Prix will get underway on Sunday, August 3 from 11pm (AEST).

    "content": "Melbourne might have a new challenger for the title of Australia’s sporting capital after a city landed a new event with a “unique” twist. Perth is continuing to mount a case as one of the sporting capitals of Australia after landing a new event to be held on the pristine waters off the Western Australian coast. Australia will have the rare honour of hosting multiple SailGP events after the Oracle Perth Sail Grand Prix was added to the 2026 calendar of the global sailing league likened to Formula One on water. Watch SailGP FREE & LIVE on Kayo Freebies. Register free now, no credit card required. Season six of SailGP will kick off in Perth on January 17-18 next year, with Australian fans getting to watch the F50s in action from waterfront grandstands for the first time at Fremantle’s Bathers Beach. The Sydney event has been a fixture on the calendar since SailGP’s inception, but the unique nature of that course means spectators are dotted around the harbour on boats and vantage points like Shark Island. There is nothing quite like watching the high-tech, colourful boats that can reach speeds of 100km/h, fly past the shoreline in front of fans sitting on the edge of the water in grandstands. Kinley Fowler, a member of Australia’s champion BONDS Flying Roos team, grew up in Perth and can’t wait to sail at home with the Fremantle doctor in the natural amphitheatre of Bathers Beach. “It’s been really exciting,” Fowler told news.com.au. “I got wind of the possibility of an event coming to Perth a couple of months ago and ever since joining SailGP at the very beginning in 2018-19, it has been a massive dream of mine to have an event come to Perth in home waters and now it’s happening. I’m super excited.” “We’ll be racing in the Freo Doctor and good breeze, which is every sailor’s dream, but we’ll also be coming within metres of all the grandstands there and in front of friends and family. “Something unique with this venue at Bathers Beach is we’re going to have grandstands on either side of the course. It really is going to feel like a stadium for us out on the water. “It feels like the sport is growing massively and to kick off the season in Perth with big grandstands, it’s going to be real stadium racing in good breeze.” Australia’s SailGP team, which won the first three seasons of the league, recently rebranded as the BONDS Flying Roos as part of a new multimillion dollar deal that saw actors Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds join the team as co-owners. “To have an iconic Australia brand like BONDS is super exciting … it makes complete sense,” said Fowler. “And to have Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds speaks volumes to how much this league is growing. “We’re really excited to see their vision because they’re creative guys and we know that they’re dreaming up something big for our team. It’s going to be exciting to see where they take it.” Australia sits second on the season five leaderboard, one point behind reigning champions Spain after six events. “This season is definitely a lot more challenging,” Fowler said. “Every year in SailGP it gets more competitive. We’re seeing a lot of this young talent come through, they’re getting used to the boats and starting to gel as a team. “It really is challenging for us and it’s something that we’re working on every day with our coaches and data analysts to try and get the edge because the unique thing about this league is that everyone is on identical boats and everyone has access to all of the data from every other boat. “It’s pretty hard to stay at the top but we have a really good culture in our team of not only having a good time, but making sure that we’re constantly trying to push the envelope with development and trying to make the boat go faster, trying to be better at manoeuvring, starting and all of the little one-percenters that can that can maintain our lead is what we’re going after now. SailGP season five continues this weekend at the Emirates Great Britain Grand Prix at Portsmouth on July this weekend, which Aussies can watch on Sunday and Mornday morning at 1am AEST. SailGP is expanding with a tender process underway for two new teams to join the league in 2026, which would grow the fleet to 14 teams. New contender for Australia’s sporting capital? SailGP’s expansion begs the question, does Perth have a case to be in the discussion as one of Australia’s sporting capital? That crown belongs to Melbourne, which boasts the F1 Australian Grand Prix, the Australian Open, AFL Grand Final, Boxing Day Test and Melbourne Cup. Brisbane has Magic Round and the pilgrimage to South Australia is becoming more popular thanks to the AFL’s Gather Round and the cricket Test match at the Adelaide Oval. Perth continues to attract major sporting events — from WWE, major Socceroos and Matildas games, overseas football friendlies and State of Origin games. A major part of Perth’s new-found sporting attraction is the state-of-the-art Optus Stadium, which has a capacity of 60,000, which is proving to be a coup for tourism to Western Australia. UFC Fight Night is coming to Perth’s RAC Arena on September 28, continuing the promotion’s relationship with the WA capital after Perth hosted UFC 284 and UFC 305. “Perth in the summertime is just an amazing place to be, particularly out on the water,” said Fowler. “We have the Freo Doctor here, which is the sea breeze which comes in every day at over 20 knots, which is the ideal conditions for anyone who does any water sports like kitesurfing or sailing or anything like that. “It’s great to come back to Perth and see how much investment is going into bring sporting events here. We’re just really happy SailGP is part of it and we get to kick off the season here.” Register for SailGP+ to receive early access and exclusive pricing for SailGP Perth from August 22.

    "content": "He has travelled the world boxing as an amateur, but rising star Callum Peters is turning heads on both sides of the world in a hot start to his professional career. He has travelled the world boxing as an amateur, but rising star Callum Peters (3-0) turned a few heads in Las Vegas two weeks ago. That’s when the 22-year-old Paris Olympian went toe-to-toe in sparring with highly regarded American super-middleweight Elijah Garcia. From South Australia, the charismatic Peters was in Sin City to watch Tim Tszyu and Manny Pacquiao, but more than held his own against the much more experienced Garcia. “He put it on him,” said one witness. “He towelled him up”. After one session, Garcia refused to do any more rounds with ‘50 Cal’. Which is a fair effort when you consider Peters only has three professional fights to his name, with a fourth, against rugged Kiwi Marcus Heywood (9-8-2), coming up on Wednesday night in Brisbane. While Peters was losing a controversial decision to eventual gold medallist Nurbek Oralbay in Paris last year, Garcia had just finished up a three fight run appearing on two Gervonta Davis undercards and one Canelo Alvarez blockbuster at venues including T-Mobile Arena and the MGM Grand. In his most recent bout, Garcia battled back from a knockdown to defeat one-time Tim Tszyu opponent Terrell Gausha by decision. Peters shrugged off the sparring showdown when asked about it in Vegas as he prepares for his second fight in five weeks. His main goal is to showcase his talents on another televised card on Wednesday. But the ironic thing is that those same talents – which include an abnormally high punch output, and some deft footwork courtesy of his now trademarked indoor football shoes – mean he hasn’t actually had the opportunity to display his skills. None of his three opponents to date have made it out of the first round. Callum Peters and his indoor football shoes up now. #ParoNavarropic.twitter.com/S6ijMLoGzH “Marcus looks like a hard boy, he’s fought some hard opponents and he’ll bring a good show,” he said. “He should make it past the first round. “Hopefully people get to see more of me. “I like to throw a lot of volume, there’s always punches going.” There were questions raised when Peters was spotted in Vegas just a week and a half before his fight with Heywood. But the amateur star is no stranger to disrupted fight prep. His first scheduled opponent in Cairns in June pulled out with Covid, and a Kiwi replacement was forced out just three days before the fight when he wasn’t allowed in the country. Another replacement was found just two days before the bout, with local Muay Thai fighter Luca Lanigan copping three heavy knockdowns before the referee mercifully waved it off. “I’ve just got back from Vegas, I’m prepped and I’m ready to go,” Peters said. “Watching Tim and Manny Pacquiao got me thinking it could be me one day fighting in front of all those people and showing everyone all the hard work I’ve been doing in the gym.” Peters has called out a who’s who of domestic fighters from middleweight to light-heavyweight, but after this week’s fight will turn his attention to the amateur world championships in September. Meanwhile, a win in Wednesday’s main event will propel Aussie-based Kiwi Floyd Masson (15-2) into world title contention. Masson takes on John Parker (11-1) – the younger brother of former heavyweight world champion Joseph Parker – and the 33-year-old year-old has his sights on the very elite of the cruiserweight division. And that could mean a potential domestic world title blockbuster. “Jai (Opetaia) is the best cruiserweight in the world,” Masson said. “At the end of the day, you’re here to fight the best and prove yourself against the best. “Those are the opportunities I’m chasing. “As a fighter, you back yourself against anyone, and I believe I can beat anyone. “We’re ready to chase down another world title.” Originally published as ‘Towelled him up’: Rising Aussie star Callum Peters looking for breakout performance after Vegas sparring stint To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Collingwood’s American AFL star has addressed the question he keeps getting asked, while praising Nick Daicos amid his Brownlow push. Collingwood big man Mason Cox says he’s unsure if he’ll remain in Australia when his AFL career wraps up, while praising Nick Daicos as the consummate professional. The Magpies are flying high on top of the ladder and will be hoping the Round 18 loss to Gold Coast, where they went goalless in the first half, was just a blip in the road to the premiership.

Get your first month for just $1. Limited-time offer. Cox’s legacy as an AFL success story is secure after he made his debut on Anzac Day in 2016, tore apart the 2018 preliminary final against Richmond and became a premiership player in 2023. Collingwood face some tough list calls this off-season over their experienced group of 10 veterans aged over 30, most of which are out of contract. They are Scott Pendlebury, Steele Sidebottom, Jeremy Howe, Jack Crisp, Brody Mihocek, Will Hoskin-Elliott, Tim Membrey, Jamie Elliott, Tom Mitchell and Cox. All of those players have had their moments in the black and white, but there will be an unlucky few who aren’t offered new deals at Collingwood. Speaking to news.com.au in his capacity as a Toyota ambassador, Cox chuckled when asked about his plans for life after football. “I get a lot of these questions as a recent,” the 34-year-old from Texas said. “I do I think I’ll end up just kind of sussing out, I guess opportunities like I do want to stay here (in Australia) long term, but like with anything once footy finishes up hopefully in a few years time it’s not so much transferable job to other industries. “So we’ll kind of see what s pans out what opportunities come up and hopefully there’s something I can be extremely passionate about and be able to sink my teeth into it. If that’s here in Australia, then so be it.” Cox has played seven games so far this season but has fallen out of the AFL team with the emergence of ruckman Darcy Cameron along with Dan McStay’s return from injury. “I’ll keep doing everything within my power to try to put my hand up,” the 211cm ruck-forward said. “Hopefully that opportunity comes soon, but it’s a sign that the club’s in a good position. “There’s plenty of talent coming through and I guess a healthy list at the same time.” One young Collingwood star is Nick Daicos, who is the favourite for the Brownlow Medal heading into the home stretch of the season. The 22-year-old has shortened with the bookies ahead of Adelaide’s Jordan Dawson, Geelong recruit Bailey Smith and Gold Coast Suns captain Noah Anderson. “He’s just a constant professional,” Cox said of Daicos. “He’s obviously got a spotlight on him every single week and he’s still gathering Brownlow votes even with someone hanging off his shoulder the whole game. So it’s a credit to him. “He is one of those players that comes in super mature, got into the leadership group this year, which is pretty impressive at that age. “He’s really going to be I think the face of this club for a long time. As an older player kind of looking at what he’s been able to do in such a short time, it’s pretty impressive to be able to stand next to him. “At one point I’ll probably be telling people I played with Nick Daicos and have a bit of a laugh about it. “It’s a credit to him. Having his brother and dad there has helped him kind of feel comfortable and be able to grow and become one of the leaders of the clubs so quickly, which is impressive.” Collingwood are aiming to win their third premiership this century and create more iconic grand final moments on the way. Heath Shaw’s smother on Nick Riewoldt in the 2010 grand final replay has been recreated by Shaw and comedians Ryan Shelton and Matt Okine as part of Toyota’s Legendary Moments, which you can watch in the video above. “I actually had never heard of AFL when it ever happened. I didn’t actually start AFL until 2014. But it’s definitely lived on in folklore,” Cox said. “I’s one of those moments where it’s not something you really can teach. It’s just purely a gutsy move to, to be able to make that effort. It’s a credit film. It was kind of what AFL is all about really is just kind of maximum effort, having the maximum impact.” The return of Toyota’s Legendary Moments coincides with Toyota’s Good for Footy Program, which supports clubs across the country with initiatives such as the Good for Footy Raffle. Toyota’s Good for Footy Raffle helps local football clubs across Australia raise much-needed funds with all proceeds going directly to community clubs to support junior development, facilities, and the future of the game. Toyota is also running the Toyota Good For Footy Raffle, which is a fundraiser aimed at helping grassroots footy clubs. “It’s a good way for clubs to essentially raise money. Toyota has put $250,000 for grabs through raffles. You can put through on club and 100 per cent of the profits from the raffle go to the club itself. So it’s a great way to of raise money for local football clubs.” “A lot of American sport is quite professional now to the point where there’s not as much accessibility for the fans to be able to talk and interact with the players,” Cox added. “So it’s pretty cool in that sense with AFL.” Fans are encouraged to visit https://toyotagoodforfooty.raffletix.com.au/ to support their local club, purchase raffle tickets, and view exclusive content from this year’s campaign.

    "content": "Ambulances were called to the iconic wrestler’s home in Florida early on Thursday morning following rumours he had been ill for several weeks. Iconic wrestler Hulk Hogan has died aged 71 after he suffered a heart attack at his Florida home on Thursday, US time. Hogan’s manager Chris Volo told NBC that the star died surrounded by loved ones. There had been concerns about his health for several weeks but Hogan’s wife Sky had assured fans that while Hogan was recovering after several operations there was “no need to panic”. Tragically, and despite the optimism, Hogan did not make it through his recovery. World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) confirmed Hogan’s death and said it was “saddened to learn WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan had passed away”. The organisation said Hogan, as Terry Bollea was known professionally, was “one of pop culture’s most recognisable figures” who had helped WWE achieve “global recognition” in the 1980s. In the video above: The Hulk Hogan betrayal that changed wrestling forever US President Donald Trump said on social media the “Hulkster” was a “great friend” and “MAGA all the way”. He applauded Hogan’s “absolutely electric speech” at last July’s Republican National Convention. “(Hogan was) strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart. He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive.” President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, said simply: “R. I. P to a legend”. Police confirmed an ambulance was called to Hogan’s home in Clearwater, west of Tampa, at 9.51am on Thursday (11.51pm AEST). “The nature of the call was for a cardiac arrest. A 71-year-old resident … Hulk Hogan, was treated by Clearwater Fire & Rescue crews before being taken by Sunstar to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased,” police said in a statement. Police added that there were “no signs of foul play or suspicious activity”. He is survived by his wife, children Lind and Brooke and two grandchildren. READ MORE: Hogan’s final conversation with estranged daughter READ MORE: Hogan’s ex-wife shares heartbreaking photo Vince McMahon’s heartfelt Hogan tribute Tributes have come pouring in for Hogan from around the wrestling and entertainment world. The Undertaker said: “The wrestling world has lost a true legend. His contributions to our business are immeasurable and for that I am appreciative. Thank you, Hulk Hogan.” Wrestling legend Sting wrote on Instagram: “HULK HOGAN - THE GREATEST OF ALL “Can’t thank you enough for all that you did for me and for wrestling fans all over the world. I loved you and I will miss you. My friend, Terry Bollea, RIP.” I Am Absolutely Shocked To Hear About The Passing Of My Close Friend @HulkHogan! Hulk Has Been By My Side Since We Started In The Wrestling Business. An Incredible Athlete, Talent, Friend, And Father! Our Friendship Has Meant The World To Me. He Was Always There For Me Even Whenâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/rOWLakMjr4 Former WWE boss Vince McMahon said: “The world lost a treasure today. “Hulk Hogan was the greatest WWE Superstar of ALL TIME, someone who was loved and admired around the world. He was a trailblazer, the first performer who transitioned from being a wrestling star into a global phenomenon. “His grit and unbridled thirst for success were unparalleled — and made him the consummate performer. He gave everything he had to the audience whom he appreciated, respected and loved. “He leaves us with one of his favorite expressions, ‘Train, take your vitamins and say your prayers.’ Today, we pray for him.”McMahon, who co-founded the modern WWE with his wife, Linda, was one of the most instrumental figures in the rise of Hogan. McMahon and Hogan had an up-and-down relationship over the years, which was complex and often contentious. The duo worked closely together as The Hulkster rose to fame in the 1980s — McMahon recruited Hogan to join the then-WWF in 1984, and the wrestler developed into a megastar in the following years. But the pair had a falling out when Hogan testified against McMahon in a 1993 trial that accused the latter of distributing steroids to his wrestlers. McMahon went on to temporarily ban Hogan from WWE after the wrestler’s racist comments were made public in 2015, before ultimately bringing him back. Recent poor health Acquaintances of Hogan have claimed he had been in poor health since at least the beginning of July. But Hogan’s wife Sky said Hogan was “healing” and there was “no need for panic” despite “intense” surgeries. “No, he’s definitely not in a coma! His heart is strong, and there was never any lack of oxygen or brain damage … none of those rumours are true,” she reportedly wrote on Instagram this month. “He’s been recovering from a major four-level Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion which is an intense surgery with a long and layered healing process. “We’ve been in and out of the hospital to support that recovery. “So truly, there’s no need for the drama or panic some people try to stir up,” she added. “He’s healing, and we’re taking it one day at a time with love, strength, and patience.” Estranged ex-wife shares sad last picture Hulk Hogan’s estranged ex-wife shared a sweet throwback picture of them just days before the wrestling star died from cardiac arrest. She gushed about the “good old days” in the now-heartwrenching post four days before the 71-year-old WWE legend’s death. Just days before Hogan’s death, his ex-wife Linda Hogan, who he was married to until 2009, shared a throwback picture of the couple at a convention in 1996. In the picture, Linda stunned in a black dress as the couple embraced. Hogan wore his iconic red and yellow Hulkster WCW costume, including his Hogan bandana over his bleach-blond hair, red pants, and yellow tank top. “The good old days,” Linda wrote in the now-heartwrenching caption. In the comments, fans gushed over the memories and said that they were praying for Hogan to recover from his health battle. Hogan’s final conversation with estranged daughterHulk Hogan and his daughter, Brooke, may have had a rocky relationship in recent years, but they still had a lot of love for each other. “He was very proud of her, she was his little girl,” a rep for Brooke told Page Six. “We still can’t believe he is gone.” Their last conversation, which allegedly took place two weeks before her father tied the knot with Daily, involved Brooke telling her father she loved him, reports TMZ. Brooke allegedly told her father how deep love and concern for his wellbeing went, and shared she wanted him to slow down his career due to his health problems. While Hulk didn’t listen to his daughter’s advice, he did extend a vague apology to his daughter. Dominated WWE in the 1980s Born in Augusta, Georgia, in 1953, Hogan started wrestling in 1977 after dropping out of university and soon joined the Word Wrestling Federation which became the WWE. The name “Hulk” came from TV series The Incredible Hulk which was popular at the time. Hogan’s charisma and flamboyance – including his trademark handlebar moustache, bandannas and theatrical ripping off of his shirt – helped propel him to stardom. His charm, ability to whip up a crowd and antics in the ring led him to achieve the fame few other wrestlers were able to sustain. Some considered his showmanship to surpass his actual wrestling ability. Yet he was WWE champion six times, albeit in a choreographed fusion of entertainment and sport. The adoration of fans and the ensuing “Hulkamania” kept him at the forefront of WWE. After he stopped wrestling, Hogan began an acting career in films and TV. In 2015, Hogan apologised after a video of him using racial slurs emerged. The next year, he settled a court case with website Gawker after it had earlier published part of a sex tape involving him. He had accused the website of defamation, loss of privacy, and emotional pain and was initially awarded $140 million. Following Hogan’s win, Gawker – then a popular site – went bankrupt and shut down. A teenage phenom has dropped the jaws of swimming commentators with an apoplectic response to winning a gold medal.

    "content": "An former Wallabies star is trying a new sport that has him set to make his Olympic debut at age 40 in American prime time. Quade Cooper will be 40 years old by the time the 2028 Olympic Games come around, but he is hoping to make history in Los Angeles. The 75-cap Wallabies playmaker has played for the Kintetsu Liners in Japan for several years, but he’s unsure if he’ll return for another season of rugby union as he shifts his focus to his new passion, flag football. Cooper, 37, first caught the eye with a one-handed overhead pass during a rugby game in Japan and has gone viral on social media for his impressive trick passes. Tszyu vs Fundora 2 & Pacquiao vs Barrios | SUN 20 JULY 10AM AEST | Tim Tszyu faces Sebastian Fundora in a blockbuster rematch, plus Manny Pacquiao makes his highly anticipated return to the ring to face Mario Barrios. | Order now with Main Event on Kayo Sports “There was a game in Japan I played in two years ago, I actually threw one in a live game, just it was off the cuff, Cooper told news.com.au, speaking in his capacity as an investor in Aussie electrolyte brand HYRO. “It definitely wasn’t planned. I wanted to kick it across the field and someone was going to charge me down so I just threw it.” Cooper said Flag Football Australia got in touch with him after seeing his passing skills and brought up the prospect of playing in the Olympics as quarterback. “Those conversations just continued to grow and when I decided to finish up with my team in Japan, I was coming back here on holiday. “I haven’t fully closed the door on Japan yet but I was going back in my off-season break and there was a tournament over in LA. “So I jumped in on that and went over there, and I had so much fun. So it’s really swaying me to look at doing that full-time. “This sport is literally just grabbing the most fun parts of playing in the backyard and putting it onto a professional field.” He’s just returned from his first games with Australia’s Flag Football program in LA, which he said was “super fun” but he is still getting used to the game. “One of the hardest aspects of is there’s no contact, it’s just seems like you’re playing backyard footy having a bit of fun,” Cooper said. “When you’re playing rugby league or union, you never have to try and get yourself up for the contest because it’s a physical, combative collision sport, so if you’re not up for it you’re going to get hurt. “There’s a rule (in flag football) that the rusher can’t even touch the quarterback. If he hits you and makes contact, it’s a penalty. “There’s a lot of detail in rugby and rugby league but this to me was just on another level. It was about how many steps you’re taking before you have a cut. The detail is what I love about it. “One of the biggest drivers of me playing flag was being able to play quarterback, do this thing that was super fun, but also learn something new.” The LA 2028 Olympics will see five new sports added to the program — baseball/softball, lacrosse, squad and flag football, which is set to make a prime time debut. This week the schedule for the 2028 Games was released, with flag football taking centre stage in the first week of competition. Organisers have also parted with tradition and shifted swimming to the second week, moving athletics to the opening week of competition. Cooper had been set to represent Australia at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rugby Sevens, only to be denied that chance when his citizenship application was knocked back. He finally became an Australian citizen in 2022 and he is now turning his attention to flag football, hoping the non-contact nature of the sport allows him to play until he’s 40. “The Olympics is just the pinnacle of sport, so this would be amazing to be able to go there and do and compete for Australia, represent Australia in a new sport,” Cooper said. “Being a part of the Olympics and the possibility of having a medal is something that I just think will be super special.” Cooper jokes he’s “still a spring chicken, being able to play the game until I’m 37”, but added “not taking hits” was a big motivator for him taking up flag football. Shirtless photos of Cooper at training for flag football show a man who is still at the top of his game as a professional athlete. “I’m 37 so I still feel in great shape in the sense of I’m fit, strong and can still play the game, but another three years of getting hit, that’s a tough ask,” he said. “While you’ve still got the fire, do it as long as you can. I still have that competitive fire, but I’m not too sure I want to continue getting hit until I’m 39.” What is flag football? A combination of gridiron and Oztag, flag football is a non-contact sport where the aim is to advance up the field and score a touchdown in the opposition’s end zone. ‘Tackles’ are made by removing one of two vinyl ‘flags’ attached to the ball-carrier’s waist - one on each side. Each team, comprised of five players, has four attempts, known as downs, to reach the halfway line. If unsuccessful, the ball is turned over to the opposition, who start on their own five-yard line. Cooper has noticed flag football growing rapidly in popularity in children, particularly with parents increasingly conscious of concussion concerns from contact sport. “The exciting thing about it is that there’s always people looking for sports that are similar to rugby, similar to league, without the contact,” he said. “This opens up an avenue for parents to be able to allow their kids, both boys and girls, to do something without the threat of concussions, broken necks, multiple surgeries and whatnot. “It does open another avenue for everybody here in Australia.” Cooper and NRL star Daly Cherry-Evans are both investors in electrolyte hydration brand HYRO, and while DCE says he’s taking it one year at a time, it’s no secret the veterans care about what goes into their body. Cooper said: “Water is great but like it’s just not enough, it’s just the bare minimum. Adding electrolytes, it’s a must. ”You go across all footy teams, all elite sport, everybody’s using electrolytes. “Longevity, and being able to stay in the game for a long time, you’ve got to evolve and learn got to learn. Put better things in my body from what I eat, how I lift weights, to having a routine and how I wake up every day. “All those things add in and hydration is a massive, massive part of that.” Cherry-Evans is leaving Manly at season’s end but he remains tight lipped on where his future lies in the NRL, with all signs pointing to the veteran half joining Roosters. “No update there,” Cherry-Evans told news.com.au when asked about his future. “I’m just going to keep taking my time and make sure I make the right decision for myself and my family. “But (I’ve) definitely still got a fire burning. That’s always the most important thing, is you’ve got love for the game and a desire to keep competing. “My focus right now is where it needs to be, and that’s for the Manly side this year. “We’re sitting around that top eight at the moment, which is great. There’s definitely lots of improvement left in us for the back end of the year. “So if we can focus in and keep playing consistent footy, which we’ve done the last month, be able to play finals footy again, which is a big driving force for the team and I.” To join the conversation, please log in.

Tadej Pogacar closed out a supreme 21-day performance to win the Tour de France in a rainy Paris, crushing his rivals to rack up a fourth title. Wout van Aert won the final-day cliffhanger on the cobbled roads of Montmartre, but Pogacar was spared any late challenge when the weather forced organisers to neutralise times to avoid potential accidents. However Pogacar more than played his part on the final in a six-man breakaway during a thrilling finale before Belgian Van Aert pulled away on the last climb. “I was really happy they neutralised the times of the GC (general classification),” Pogacar said. “Then it was more relaxed to race and you just had to have good legs to be in front. I tried but hats off to Wout, he was incredibly strong. It was a really nice race.” Runner-up Jonas Vingegaard was unable to contend with Pogacar, but the winner praised the Dane for having helped him improve over the years. “I spoke to Jonas today. We’ve been racing each other for five years now and we have raised each other to a higher level,” Pogacar said. Despite the rain, tens of thousands of spectators packed Montmartre to follow Pogacar’s progress up and down the narrow lanes of the popular tourist spot. He played to the delighted crowds by racing to the head of the peloton near the Moulin Rouge cabaret at the foot of the climb before Van Aert produced a well-timed attack to drop Pogacar and charge to the finish line on the Champs-Elysees avenue. Pogacar was fourth on the day but after wins in 2020, 2021 and 2024, he again proved untouchable in the world’s greatest bike race. Vingegaard, the champion in 2022 and 2023, suffered two shocking off-days and ended second overall, 4min 24sec adrift. “We came out fighting in the first week and after stage five I felt I had the legs to win. It was clinched in the second week,” Pogacar said. Breakout German star Florian Lipowitz took third on his debut, rounding out the podium a distant 11 minutes off the pace in third. Defending his title, Pogacar embarked from the start in Lille as clear favourite and won four stages along the way. In the first week, he struck on rolling runs in the north and west at Rouen and the Mur de Bretagne. He then turned the screw on the slopes of the Pyrenees in week two with his rivals as good as vanquished. Vingegaard suffered on the stage-five time trial, and again in the second week at the Hautacam mountain, leaving the Dane in shock as his form abandoned him. In need of a massive turn around in the Alps, Pogacar adopted mature tactics and sat on his rival’s wheel. After it was all over, a radiant Pogacar said he could finally relax. “Everybody has different ideas about how to celebrate. I want some peace and beautiful weather, enjoying some quiet days at home,” he said. A barnstorming first week of the Tour revealed a raft of emerging stars. Lipowitz was given a run for his money for third place by 22-year-old Scot Oscar Onley, whose steady ride propelled him to fourth overall. The pair came first and second in the white jersey battle for the best under-25 rider adding hopes of a new rivalry on the race. Ireland’s Ben Healy bagged a stage win and a two-day stint in the yellow jersey. Adding a heroic near-miss on Mont Ventoux was enough to earn Healy the prize for combativity, voted for by the public. The return of Dave Brailsford from his role at Manchester United to Ineos Grenadiers was overshadowed by the team’s Italian powerhouse Filippo Ganna falling early on stage one. He was withdrawn due to concussion. Having previously masterminded seven overall Tour de France wins, Brailsford dug in and the team’s Dutch climber Thymen Arensman pulled off heists in the Pyrenees and the Alps to win two stages. France’s sole and unexpected stage win came on the lunar-like summit of Mont Ventoux when Valentin Paret-Peintre won an enthralling war of attrition with Healy. The 2025 Tour though will be remembered for Pogacar’s all-round dominance, where he adopted a more measured approach.dmc/gj Originally published as Imperious Tadej Pogacar wins Tour de France for fourth time To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Quiet achieving jockey Jason Collett has laid the platform for a big spring following his best-ever season in Sydney, and he won’t be content with just riding winners. The evolution of Jason Collett sits on the precipice of entering its most significant phase. Collett, one of racing’s quiet achievers, has been riding in Sydney for the past decade but there’s a sense the Kiwi-born hoop is riding as well as ever. This week alone, the 34-year-old has ridden seven city winners – headlined by a four-timer at Royal Randwick last Saturday. It helped cement Collett’s best-ever finish in the Sydney jockeys’ premiership, a second behind James McDonald, with a new career benchmark of 74 city winners for the campaign. Add in his biggest ever Group 1 triumph aboard Stefi Magnetica in the Doncaster Mile in the autumn and a career-best 18 stakes winners, it’s easy to see why now more than ever Collett is considered among Sydney’s elite. • PUNT LIKE A PRO: Become a Racenet iQ member and get expert tips – with fully transparent return on investment statistics – from Racenet’s team of professional punters at our Pro Tips section.  NOW! Behind it all remains a laid-back and calm demeanour with an insatiable appetite for more. “I want more Group 1s,” Collett said. “I want bigger race wins and those stakes wins help lead to that. “That’s what you need. To get on more of those better horses in those better races but it’s evolving nicely.” Collett is quick to identify Stefi Magnetica and Group 1 Champagne Stakes runner-up Within The Law as two of those “better horses”. Just this week, he got the chance to jump back aboard Within The Law as the Bjorn Baker-trained filly had her first trial this preparation at Rosehill Gardens on Tuesday. Baker has aspirations of aiming Within The Law at Sydney’s Princess Series with a Group 1 Flight Stakes tilt on the agenda on October 4 where she is an $8 third elect. • Rosehill Turf Talk: Mitch’s big throw at stumps on $151 shot Within The Law saves her best work for race day with Collett keen to see her back at the races. “She doesn’t show a lot in trials or a lot in trackwork either so there isn’t really a great deal to get excited about after a trial,” he said. “We gave her a nice hitout and she was pushed out, that’s the norm with her. “It would be great to get a Group 1 with her and the Flight Stakes would be the target and we know she will run the mile. “The 1400m and a mile is going to be her and those early races could potentially be a bit sharp.” Stefi Magnetica gave both Baker and Collett the biggest wins of their careers when she won the Group 1 Doncaster Mile on Day 1 of The Championships. Another big spring campaign looms. “She is going to head towards weight-for-age racing now because she has won two of the biggest handicaps (including the Stradbroke),” Collett said. “I have no worries she will be able to do it. “Hopefully she can win another Group 1 now.” While Group 1s are sweet, Collett has made a habit of making his presence felt on regular occasions in town in recent seasons. He isn’t one to set specific premiership targets at the beginning of a season but the carrot of finishing second in the Sydney title race for the first time added fuel to his late form surge. A midweek treble at Warwick Farm helped Collett eclipse his previous season best of 72 Sydney winners and edge out Zac Lloyd (67 winners) for the runner-up spot. “When it got to the last month and a half and I thought I was obviously close enough to Zac, I thought we will try and get second if we can,” Collett said. “(wife) Clare and I had a family holiday booked in early July but in saying that, as it evolved, I thought if we were close enough it would be good to get. “As it turned out it ended up being quite comfortable in the end.” • Schiller gets green light for early spring return Collett can pick up where he left off and get the new season off to a flying start aboard the Chris Waller-trained Narbold in the Capitivant @ Kia Ora Benchmark 72 Handicap (1500m) at Rosehill Gardens on Saturday. Waller runners will make up half of the field in the opener with Narbold ($4.20) only shaded by Amusing ($2.90 favourite) in betting. Collett partnered Narbold two starts ago when a close second behind Centenario in a 1550m event at Canterbury before the gelding finishing fourth behind Amusing at the same track and trip last start. “He just seemed to find one better when he loomed up two starts ago off a good tempo,” Collett said. “His run last start was good when he was ridden on speed and I think he is better when he’s ridden a bit quieter. “From the barrier he should get a soft run in what looks to be a small field.” The Richard and Will Freedman-trained Cold Brew mirrors Collett’s hot streak with the emerging talent set to hunt three straight wins in the Midway Benchmark 72 Handicap (1400m). Cold Brew, a $4.80 chance, has put together victories at Hawkesbury and Newcastle and deserves another crack in town. “He’s in a Midway horses where there is a few older horses there but he’s progressive,” Collett said. “I am looking forward to him. “The ground will no doubt be a question mark for every horse but he is going well and when I rode him two back he won easily. “He was tough last start when they got to him and he was a bit green but he is going well.” • NSW racing in the hands of weather gods Collett is hopeful King Taurus ($15) can bring his polytrack form to town in the TAB Highway Class 3 Handicap (1200m) while he’s happy to wait patiently for the chance to pilot Catch The Glory ($15) late in the card. The Jason Coyle-trained Catch The Glory ($15) is second-up in the Congratulations Chris Waller Benchmark 78 Handicap (1100m). “I think Catch The Glory is a good ride,” Collett said. “She was out of her grade last start but had been trialling up really well. “She is out of Zousain so should handle the wet and I think she is going well this horse.” Racing is expected to take place on another heavy track in Sydney with rain forecast on Friday and race day. Few ride wet conditions better than Collett. “I don’t have any secret to it, it’s just get them to travel and balance and if they get through it, they get through it,” Collett said.

    "content": "Reigning Formula One champion Max Verstappen has ended weeks of speculation by addressing his future at Red Bull for 2026 and beyond amid the team's recent struggles. Max Verstappen ended weeks of speculation about his future on Thursday when the reigning Formula One world champion said he would be staying with Red Bull in 2026. Verstappen said it was time to “stop all the rumours”. “I’ve never really said anything about it because I was just focused on talking to the team about how we can improve our performance,” the Dutchman explained at the Hungaroring circuit ahead of this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix. “And that’s why I had nothing really to add, but I think it’s time to basically stop all the rumours. “For me, it’s always been quite clear that I was staying anyway.” Four-time world champion Verstappen’s future became a subject of speculation after rival driver George Russell revealed his Mercedes team were talking to the Dutchman’s management about his future plans. It emerged that there was a performance clause in Verstappen’s contract that offered him a chance to leave Red Bull if he was not in the top three at the end of July. But that clause has now elapsed and he will stay with Red Bull next year, the first season following a sweeping change of technical regulations. Verstappen is contracted to Red Bull until the end of 2028 and a similar scrutiny of his contract is expected next year once it becomes clear which teams have adapted and progressed best under the new regulations. Verstappen has fallen 81 points behind series leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren into third place in the drivers’ championship this year. Red Bull are in a state of flux, after sacking their team principal Christian Horner this month and replacing the Briton with Laurent Mekies, the boss of their ‘B’ team Racing Bulls. Horner’s departure will have pleased Verstappen’s father Jos, who turned against the man who had led Red Bull from their launch in 2024 following last year’s accusation by a woman colleague of “inappropriate behaviour”. The Englishman was twice cleared over the claims by the Formula One team’s parent company, Red Bull GmbH. At the Belgian Grand Prix last weekend Max Verstappen insisted Horner’s shock departure had no impact on his future plans. He said the well-publicised discord between his father and Horner was never a problem. Max Verstappen confirms he's staying at Red Bull next season ðŸ‘€#F1#HungarianGPpic.twitter.com/6ToNBPw4Tq “People can have a difference of opinion and I expect that to happen because if everyone agrees, there is a problem.” On Thursday when asked about his future after next year he replied: “If you ask me that question next year, then yes, we’ll have that speculation, but I never speak about it because I am more interested in working on performance - and that’s why I never really talk about what is in my contract.” Despite McLaren and their two drivers Piastri and Lando Norris dominating this season, he said he still retained hopes of gaining some success before the end of the year. “I know that the cars will be different next year, but there are still things that you can take out of this year on the engineering side of things and also implement for next year. “So, you cannot just say ‘Okay, we’re not winning the championship this year, so we just write it off completely’. “No-one really knows where they will be at next year.” Originally published as Max Verstappen silences Red Bull exit rumours ahead of Hungarian GP To join the conversation, please log in.

    "content": "Borrowers hoping for relief from strict lending rules have been dealt a blow as regulators refuse to budge on tough mortgage stress tests. ANALYSIS If you’re in mortgage prison, you just had a parole hearing. And the result? Parole denied. That was the outcome when the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) announced recently that it would be keeping the 3 per cent mortgage repayment ‘stress test’ buffer in place. That’s right, we’re not being prudent enough! And we must be regulated. The buffer dictates that anyone applying for a home loan is ‘stress tested’ at a loan repayment rate 3 per cent higher than what they will actually be paying if successful in their loan application. MORE: Shock RBA twist as home prices surge So, if you want to borrow money at 6 per cent, the bank will check your income and financial habits to make sure you could make repayments at 9 per cent interest. You know, just in case there is a series of rate rises. They don’t want you to default and lose that dream home. Only problem is, for a lot of people, the rule is stopping them getting a home at all. Let’s be real here. Interest rates are coming down. They are not going to go up 3 per cent in the near term. The stress buffer started out at 2 per cent in 2014. It went to 2.5 per cent in 2019 on the back of a growth cycle that left many borrowers overexposed to the risk of a market correction. It was rightly increased to 3 per cent in October 2021 when the official cash rate was at 0.1 per cent and there were variable rate home loans with interest rates below 2 per cent. The only way was up at that time. Now is a completely different story. We have seen a cost of living crisis, stagnant wages, and rising house prices, yet someone who has somehow managed to scrape a deposit together needs to be able to show they can make repayments at a level not seen from variable interest rates since before the 2008 GFC. MORE: 34-year-old goes from broke to $100m This is especially difficult for young people, as noted by my colleague Jonathan Chancellor in his Sydney Weekend column, who quoted Michael Sukkar, the Coalition’s shadow housing minster during the 2025 election campaign, criticising APRA’s “one size fits all” rule as preventing nearly 40 per cent of first home buyers from getting a loan. That type of outcome is disastrous for future generations. But possibly the most absurd thing is that some people already with a mortgage who are struggling to make repayments might see a loan out there with a lower interest rate, but they won’t be able to refinance to it because they don’t pass the stress test. They might be paying 6 per cent currently, but if they wanted to pay 5.5 per cent, they’d have to prove they can pay 8.5 per cent. MORE:Aus bank slashes rates to lowest level in two years Just that 0.5 per cent difference would save you more than $300 a month on a $1 million mortgage and $114,000 over 30 years. Granted, there is a workaround for some lenders, who are able to use discretion to assess some borrowers at 1 or 2 per cent buffers, but for those who don’t qualify? They are stuck in mortgage prison. And it’s looking like APRA hasn’t just left the keys in its ‘other pants’, but has thrown them away altogether. The 3 per cent buffer stayed in place even when the cash rate was at 4.35 per cent and there were borrowers being assessed at 10 per cent in order to get a 7 per cent home loan. Now that the cash rate and variable rates are both on the way down, adjusting the buffer is becoming less urgent, so expect more borrowers to miss out as APRA stays firm. Originally published as APRA’s refusal to revise the 3 per cent stress test keeps Aussies locked in mortgage prison Troy ‘Candy’ Williams threw a wild bash and now it can be revealed it has ties to The Block’s billionaire buyer Adrian Portelli, who has delivered an ultimate blow to Nine.

    "content": "A $150m childcare company has kept quiet on its response to the Joshua Brown allegations, even as other centres flag major changes. A major childcare company has so far kept quiet about how it might respond to this month’s shock Joshua Brown allegations, even as other large providers flag major changes to child safety. Nido Education, an ASX-listed $150m provider with more than 100 centres nationwide, has not produced a public statement on the horrific child sex abuse allegations against Mr Brown since they first broke on July 1. Victoria Police allege the educator sexually abused eight children while working for G8 Education, a different childcare provider, at the Creative Gardens Point Cook centre between October 2021 and February 2024. Mr Brown worked in at least 23 centres across Victoria between January 2017 and May 2025, including a short stint at a Nido centre in Werribee between June 21 and July 14 in 2021. The allegations against Mr Brown are for alleged offending that occurred at Creative Gardens between October 2021 and February 2024. There is no allegation that Mr Brown offended against children while working for Nido. The allegations, which include alleged offending against victims as young as five months, have rocked the nation, and providers have now flagged dramatic changes to their operations. On July 8, G8 said it would accelerate the rollout of CCTV cameras to all of its more than 400 centres and give parents greater choice over their children’s care, including preferences on which educators support their child’s personal care routines, including nappy changes and toileting. On July 9, Affinity, a private-equity backed provider, announced it would fast-track the installation of CCTV across all of its centres “to enhance supervision and safety” and seek parental preferences on who helps their child with toileting or nappy changes. Affinity said it would also review centre layouts “to identify and rectify blind spots as well as auditing visibility into all care centres” and conduct formal consultations with its workers, parents and regulators on “additional safety measures”. On July 10, Only About Children released a statement to NewsWire outlining the “ongoing work” it had taken to sharpen child safety in the past 12 months, including enhanced recruitment screening, additional safeguarding and incident reporting training for all campus directors and greater oversight of casual employees. “Beyond policies and training, we take a proactive approach to child safety education,” an Only About Children spokeswoman told NewsWire. “Over the past year, we have introduced Bunji, our health and safety mascot, as part of a developmentally appropriate body safety program embedded in our curriculum. “Bunji plays a central role in helping children settle into care, understand safe practices and navigate big emotions in a friendly and age-appropriate way.” The provider also said it was “assessing” the role of CCTV across a small number of its centres. “While CCTV may offer additional visibility in certain situations, our experience so far has shown it is not a stand-alone solution,” she said. “There are important considerations regarding privacy, clarity of footage and the expectations of both families and educators. “Any future decisions will be guided by campus-specific safeguarding risk assessments. “These assessments help us identify and prioritise risk areas and determine the most effective responses. “Our focus remains on implementing measures that support educators in providing proactive supervision, visibility and audibility in real time, rather than relying solely on reactive tools such as CCTV.” Mr Brown worked at Affinity centres and at Only About Children’s Williamstown centre from October 28 2020 to March 29, 2021. There is no allegation that Mr Brown offended against children while working for Affinity or Only About Children. NewsWire contacted Nido last week seeking information on any changes the company might make to child safety in light of the allegations and why it had not informed the public about Mr Brown’s short interaction with its Werribee centre, but the company declined to comment. The ABC also revealed on Thursdaythat Nido had sacked Mr Brown during his probation period at Werribee for breaching the company’s internal policies. Nido acknowledged the sacking in a statement to the ABC. Nido operates more than 100 childcare and kindergartens across NSW, the ACT, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. In its full-year results for 2024, Nido reported $166.8m in revenues and $19.5m in net profits after tax. “Nido anticipates that 2025 will bring significant positive changes to the sector, as both major political parties recognise the necessity for substantial investment in the early education sector,” the results report, released in February, states. The company also flagged a lift in demand for childcare services into 2026. “With child care being central to campaign themes, there is potential for further policies aimed at reducing access costs for families,” the report states. “Such initiatives could significantly alleviate cost-of-living pressures and create pathways for families to enter or re-enter the workforce. These measures are expected to add considerably to demand.” Governments are moving to implant large-scale changes around child safety into the sector. For one, Federal Education Minister Jason Clare has flagged changes to background checks for childcare workers. Mr Brown held a working with children check during his time as an educator. The Victorian government, meanwhile, has moved to ban mobile phones for workers at centres, with the ban set to come into effect in September. Providers will be fined $50,000 for breaching the ban. It has also launched a “short and sharp” review into childcare safety, headed by former South Australian premier Jay Weatherill, with a report expected back on August 15. The expected ramp up in safety regulations comes as the sector struggles with surging demand and a dearth of available staff. In a United Workers Union survey of childcare workers, launched on June 10, some 77 per cent of educators said they were operating below minimum staffing requirements. Further, some 77 per cent said they had come to or stayed at work while sick because of understaffing and 74 per cent said they had stayed back at work to compensate for staff shortages. “Partly because of understaffing, we see a real churn of staff moving through centres and that’s when we don’t have that safe, quality environment we need,” UWU early education director Carolyn Smith said. “This survey reveals it is essential to have long-term staff who are experienced, who are trained and who are confident to raise issues. “A better early education system requires a national approach in both regulation and funding, and we must listen to educators about what the problems really are. “We already know the alternative is unacceptable and the cost of failing our children is immeasurable.” Some 2100 educators have responded to the survey as of last week. Protesters tried to confront the CEO of South Australian oil and gas giant Santos on Wednesday, demanding money to clean up the state’s algal bloom disaster. Cocktails and a Cadillac in the centre of the room all screamed success but a big name from in Aussie entertainment wants to lift the lid on the industry.

For many Australians, a million in super has been a dream scenario. But it was more than was really necessary. Most Aussies who are retired never even got close and are absolutely fine. But for you? The person who isn’t going to retire for ages? It is possible. It’s actually even likely, if you are young enough. About half of all people aged 30 will end up with a million in super. But which half? A million dollars in super might be pretty nice to have in the future. Because the cost of living keeps going up. If inflation is high enough, a million dollars might be enough to buy Weet-Bix and keep the lights on!

No more averages please When I talk about super, I give the full story. Not just the averages. Averages are, in this context, dumb. Because almost nobody is the average. Super is not like height, where we are all fairly similar and an average is meaningful. When it comes to super, some people are like lego people and some are bigger than giraffes.

They also break your age group into 20 groups, from the zeroes on the left (no super) to the superheroes on the right (loads of super), and everyone else in the middle, in chunks of 5 per cent. This is useful because it shows you not just the average for your age, but where you stand compared to your peers. You can find yourself in the following charts (there’s one for men and one for women) 1. First find your age group, 2. Then find the tallest column that is less than your super balance. That’s your column. 3. See where your column stands. If it is the tallest you’re in the top 5 per cent, second tallest top 10 per cent, etc. If your bar is near the right side, you’re near the top. If your bar is near the left, you’re closer to the bottom. Each bar is 5 per cent of that age group. The height of the bar is the minimum dollar amount to be in that group. My super balance is just below the second bar for my age group. Which means I’m in the third group – the top 15 per cent for my age. Not too bad, not amazing. My holidays in retirement might be a week at the coast not a month of cruising the Mediterranean, but at least I should get some holidays! Where will I end up? So … who is likely to end up with a million in super? If we make some simplifying assumptions – say everyone puts in $9000 a year and gets 7 per cent returns, we see the following. The charts are the same as the ones above, but I’ve coloured red the people who are able to hit a million by age 60. For women, we see about 20 per cent of those aged 35 to 39 will hit a million by age 60. Those whose balances are over $120,000 now are on their way to seven figures. For women under 30, all of them can hit a million. If they put $9000 a year away for 30 more years and get 7 per cent returns the magic of compounding will get them over the line. The following charts are for men. More men aged 35 to 39 will hit a million in super by age 60 – about 30 per cent of them. Again, all men under 30 can hit a million in super by age 60. In reality not everyone under 30 now will get there by 60. People who have no super at age 30 are not likely to start saving $9000 a year. Putting $9000 a year away is a lot for a person making below average income in 2025, so that assumption is a bit dubious, on the other hand some of these people will still be working in 30 years and at that point $9000 a year won’t be much. The above charts are best thought of as a simplified model of what’s possible. Should you worry about your super? Obviously this is just a projection – a guess, estimate, forecast. If you get promoted to manager or act super frugal you can end up with more than the projection. If someone drops a steel beam on your head or your business goes broke, you end up with less. And if you fall in a fiery volcano the day before your 60th birthday it won’t matter at all. Super works only if civilisation still exists at retirement. And the longer the time frame you’re looking at the harder it is to predict the future. Eighteen year olds aren’t thinking about retirement and honestly good on them. Go have fun. Also, every so often history dishes up a big financial event that crashes markets and destroys wealth. If that arrives in your last five years before retirement, a lot of your good work in saving hard can be undone. The assumption I’ve made – of 7 per cent returns steadily each year – could come to look ridiculously optimistic. For anyone about to retire and stressing about the cost of living in retirement there is comfort in the knowledge that the pension is going to be there. Politicians have raised the pension age to 67 but no further rises are planned. If you can stretch your working life and savings to age 67 then the pension ($1051 per fortnight for a single) will carry you afterwards, and you needn’t worry about super at all!

    "content": "Australian shares have bounced back as major banks recover and Trump’s EU trade deal boosts investor confidence across global markets. Australia’s sharemarket snapped a brief two day losing streak on Monday after US President Donald Trump announced his latest trade deal and the major banks bounced back from their recent falls. The benchmark ASX 200 index closed up 30.8 points or 0.36 per cent at 8697.7 after hitting an intraday high of 8704.9, while the broader All Ordinaries finished in the green up 29.20 points or 0.33 per cent to 8,963.50. The Australian dollar slipped from a nine-month high on Friday buying 65.51 US cents at the time of writing. On an overall positive day, eight of the 11 sectors finished in the green, led by the telecommunications sector, the big four banks and healthcare stocks. Shares in Telstra gained 0.81 per cent to $4.95, REA Group jumped 1.34 per cent to $236.09 and CAR group added 1.72 per cent to $37.89. Market heavyweight CBA gained 1.17 per cent to $174.90 offsetting half the falls in recent days, while NAB gained 0.67 per cent to $37.76, Westpac added 0.54 per cent to $33.21 and ANZ group closed 0.30 per cent higher at $30.31. Healthcare darling CSL gained 1 per cent to $270.59, Sigma Healthcare added 1.41 per cent to $2.88 and ResMed finished 0.97 per cent higher to $41.70. The markets jumped after US President Donald Trump announced a deal with the EU to end four months of negotiations between the two economic powerhouses. Following the discussions, the EU will face a 15 per cent tariff from the US, which is down from the 25 per cent the President announced in April. European Commission chief Ursula von de Leyen described it as “a big deal, a huge deal, bringing: stability and predictability” to the two trading partners. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said global markets around the world jumped on these trade deals. “In terms of the trade deals with Japan and Europe, the tariff rate that will be implemented came in lower than initially threatened and the market is looking very positively on it,” Mr Sycamore said. Uranium shares were one of the rare misses during Monday’s trading, dragged down by news out of Boss Energy which flagged challenges out of its Honeymoon uranium project. Boss Energy shares plummeted 43.97 per cent to $1.90, Deep Yellow fell 8.34 per cent to $1.65 and Paladin Energy dropped 4.43 per cent to $6.91. “That is the uranium sector in a nutshell,” he said. “It is one where you have to be prepared for extraordinary volatility. “This was a disappointing performance day and a disappointing report by Boss Energy.” In company news, Helloworld Travel shares soared 14.14 per cent to $1.69 after the business upgraded its guidance to somewhere between $58-$62m. Stealth Group’s shares also soared 11.02 per cent to $0.70 after announcing a 50 per cent jump in pre-orders on the back of the soon to be released iPhone 17.

A high-flying real estate agent, who recently sold Mick Fanning’s home for more than $16 million, has been banned from one the country’s most exclusive restaurants for life. Troy Dowker, an agent with Michael Kollosche, is not allowed to enter Gold Coast restaurant Rick Shores “under any circumstances”. A source told news.com.au that the ban was likely to cause headaches for the agent, as the venue provides networking for the rich and famous. When contacted, Mr Dowker said: “Mate I’m just at a charity golf event, just in between holes, but mate I’ve got no comment on that, I’ll give you a call later today.” News.com.au never received another call and Mr Dowker has not replied to repeated attempts to reach him.

In a statement, Rick Shores said: “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual incidents or matters involving specific patrons.” News.com.au understands this is the first time Rick Shores co-owners David Flynn and Nick Woodward have ever banned a customer from one of their venues. An industry insider said the restaurant had been Mr Dowker’s “go-to” for wining and dining clients. Another source said it was his “regular fixture for years and he would take clients there, as well as his staff for Christmas, birthdays, and the Melbourne Cup”. They added the ban was a “huge blow to his ego”. Do you know more? Email harrison.christian@news.com.au The famous eatery on Burleigh Beach attracts many big names, including the likes of Chris Hemsworth, Miley Cyrus and Matt Damon. Since its founding in 2016, it has regularly been listed as one of the best restaurants in the country. Mr Dowker specialises in selling multimillion-dollar properties and is a major player in the Gold Coast real estate scene. In April, he sold champion surfer Mr Fanning’s property in Bilinga for more than $16 million in a pre-auction deal. The beachfront mansion known as “Rolling Seas” attracted interest from all over the world and set a new benchmark for the southern Gold Coast, Mr Dowker said at the time. Promotional material on his website boasts that he has made a total $1.5 billion in sales during his career. Last week Kollosche held its annual awards not at Rick Shores, but at the Tropic restaurant, which is next-door. Mr Dowker’s team took home a handful of gongs including salesperson of the year. The agency’s managing director, Michael Kollosche, said he had “no knowledge of any incident”. “Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for us to make any comment on Troy’s behalf,” Mr Kollosche said. “We do, however, wish to make it clear that there is nothing to suggest that this is a work or business-related incident.” Rick Shores owners Mr Flynn and Mr Woodward also own Norte and Sueno in Nobby Beach. One of the alleged ringleaders of a “large-scale” loan fraud scheme has been arrested at Crown casino wearing a Louis Vuitton bomber jacket. “It’s funny thinking about how we used to hang out together and play together, and now we’ve won this together,” one of the winning mates said.

    "content": "Government staff in one Aussie state who are looking down the barrel of mass job cuts have been left fuming following a video call update. NSW government workers facing the possibility of being jobless just before Christmas have been left with more questions than answers following an all-staff livestream meeting. Last week, Transport for NSW staff were informed via email that 950 Transport Senior Service Manager (TSSM) and Award positions would be cut, with the changes expected to be finalised by the end of 2025. Only office staff are in the firing line for these job cuts, with frontline roles exempt from the restructure. This is in addition to the previously announced reduction of 300 Senior Executive roles, more than 200 of which have already been delivered. In the email, Transport for NSW secretary Josh Murray said he knew the news would be “significant and concerning” for many people. The move is part of a bid to save $600 million in costs and “get back to a model that is sustainable long term”. On Friday, more than a week after the announcement, Mr Murray held an all-staff livestream in order to provide employees with more information and answer questions. “I know there are a lot of very specific questions as well as some general understanding that we want to dig into and we are dedicated to answering your questions and to have that conversation,” he said. Mr Murray said there was “no glossing over” the fact that Transport for NSW is facing significant cost pressures, claiming the organisation has been “living beyond our means” in recent years. Over the last five years an extra 3000 workers had been hired during and after the Covid period. Addressing the restructure, Mr Murray said a detailed branch design will commence this month, with the aim to have all Transport for NSW branches determined by the end of the year. However, it seems some of the 3500 staff who joined the livestream weren’t impressed with the secretary’s almost 40-minute long speech. One Transport for NSW employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told news.com.au that the explanations provided by Mr Murray made things “as clear as mud”. “(He) basically said a whole lot of nothing,” they said. The employee revealed that just two minutes was left for questions at the end of the livestream. Those leading the livestream ended up choosing just one question to answer from the many that were posted in the online forum, claiming many of the others had already been addressed. The question related to whether the 950 number would include “current fixed term labour hire positions that might be coming to an end”. In his response, Mr Murray said the “buckets” for labour hire or consultancies have “already been set targets”. Have you been impacted by job cuts? Share your story: alexandra.foster@news.com.au And, while they do intend to make further reductions in those areas, they have been “open” about the fact that it will be TSSM and Award roles that will be impacted. He added that, if during the process they discover areas where changes can be made that would make a real impact to the ongoing costs of the organisations, then “of course” it would be prioritised over the impacts to TSSM and award roles. News.com.au has been provided some of the questions posted by staff that were receiving the most ‘likes’ in Q&A forum during the stream. One employee pointed out the job cuts relating to senior executive staff were announced “well in advance” and have taken over a year to be implemented, with the process still ongoing. “In contrast the job cuts affecting TSSM and award roles were announced abruptly over email with very short notice and are expected to be completed by the end of December 2025,” they wrote. “Had we been given notice earlier we would have had sufficient time to explore better opportunities. How is this fair? Why weren’t we informed sooner?” The employee continued, stating staff had been asking for clarity for a long time but had been “repeatedly told and reassured that there would be no impact on award or TSSM”. “This sudden decision directly contradicts those assurances. It is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about transparency and communication and transport core values,” they wrote. Another person questioned why the initial announcement on the job cuts was circulated via email and not livestream, noting a lot of staff found out through the media. One employee questioned why Transport for NSW wasn’t using working from home as a way to save costs without losing staff. “WFH flexibility is a win-win for transport and its employees as it keeps the workforce happier which is more important than ever right now, but also reducing office cost. If ‘all avenues are being explored’, surely this is a priority,” they wrote. Another staff member asked for clarification whether fixed term contract roles would be included in the 950 figure. “We have been advised that fixed term employees are considered “out of scope“ but that contracts will not be extended beyond the end dates. This affects 1800 people,” they wrote, pointing out this suggests these job losses “are in addition to the 950 roles flagged”. At the end of the meeting, Mr Murray said all the questions would be addressed, with answers provided “through the Q&A process”. NSW Public Service Association (PSA) has slammed Transport for NSW over the latest job cuts announcement, claiming more cuts could instead be made to Senior Executive staff in order to spare other employees. “While TfNSW and the NSW Government crow that they have cut 200 Senior Executives already, the fact is there are still substantially more senior executives employed in Transport than any other Department,” the union said in a statement on Friday. “With over 1000 TSSE’s they have nearly three times the amount of senior executives within Health, despite having a quarter of Health’s workforce. “The PSA continues to call on the NSW Government to stop their protection racket for senior executives, have a look at their numbers again, and if they need to make $279 million in internal labour savings, continue reducing the size of their Senior Executives to avoid job cuts for Award staff.” Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said.

    "content": "A clever and hard-working Aussie has revealed the idea that left him “screaming” when he realised he’d pulled it off. Making other people rich inspired one Aussie to risk everything and sink $700,000 into one simple idea. Jordan Mylius, 37, was working in sales for a tanning company when he decided to focus on creating his own haircare brand, Hairification. The idea came to Mr Mylius during one of Melbourne’s multiple Covid-19 lockdowns. One of the only things you could do at the time was go to the supermarket and it was there that he came up with the idea. “I remember seeing a haircare brand launch and thinking it was a good idea. The brand looked cool, it was affordable and it was clearly selling well,” he told news.com.au. “It got the cogs turning in mind. ‘What else could be done in this space?’” MORE: Australia’s fastest growing salaries The 37-year-old has always been incredibly self-motivated. He skipped university and went to the “University of Life” instead and bought a tanning and beauty salon in his 20s. From there he got into sales and ended up being the global sales director for Aussie tanning brand Bondi Sands. During his tenure, he watched the brand go from being stocked in a handful of Priceline stores to becoming a multimillion-dollar success. Mr Mylius has always loved his career working for other people and brands, but he has always known he wanted to do something for himself. “I’ve made lots of people lots of money over the years. I needed to bite the bullet and do it for myself,” he said. “I wanted to look back and think ‘wow I achieved this’ and see my products on shelves.” So, when he saw a gap in the market to launch a haircare brand that delivered salon-quality results at supermarket prices, he jumped at it. He created a shampoo and conditioner that retailed for $25 each, aiming to help combat frizz and revitalise thinning hair. From his perspective, it is the kind of product everyone wants but usually can’t afford to spend over $100 on, like similar ones on the market. Once he had the idea and the vision, he felt he knew how to market the product, and he went all in. “I just bootstrapped it,” he said. “I used all my own savings and risked pretty much everything.” MORE: A guide to salary averages in Australia in your industry At the end of the day, launching the brand cost between $700,000 and $1 million, which involved paying for everything from marketing to the salary of a chemist to develop the formula. It sounds crazy, but the businessman explained that he figured “you can always make more money”, but you can’t fix living with regret. Mr Mylius said that part of his confidence stemmed from the fact that he believed in the product from the start. “I knew that the products worked from personally using them and from trials we did with consumers and my family and friends,” he said. “I just thought we’ve got to take the risk and put it to the market. We took the risk and it paid off.” Once the range was developed, he went straight to Coles, and it turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. Before the brand launched, Mr Mylius would go and check Coles every day, “like a loser”, waiting for it to appear on the shelves. “I actually screamed when I saw it, I was like, ‘oh my God’. I’ve worked in products for many years but there’s nothing quite like seeing your product sell that you worked really hard on,” he said. “I created this thing it is my baby.” The brand officially launched in 2023 and, in less than three years, it has generated millions. Hairification just hit $20 million in revenue without any celebrity backing and is now stocked in Coles, Woolworths and Priceline. The brand is growing rapidly, partly due to its clever use of social media. Hairification has garnered over 3 million likes on TikTok and collaborated with influencers like Kayla Jade to establish a customer base that extends beyond supermarket shoppers. Mr Mylius is loving the success, but it isn’t enough just for the brand to be generating millions; he wants more. “I’m just so focused on where I want to take this brand and business and I’m laser focused on that,” he said.

A well-known Australian fashion retailer will oppose a proposal to wind-up the business after it was hit with legal action over alleged debts, court documents reveal. General Pants Co was served with an insolvency claim on July 17 by supplier UCC Australia alleging the chain had failed to pay $69,835.92 owed for stock delivered. According to a winding up application filed in the Victorian Supreme Court, UCC Australia alleged it had unpaid invoices for the supply of cameras and film between October and December 2024. “The goods were delivered and accepted by the debtor and the invoiced amounts remain due and payable,” the document states. The supplier sent General Pants Co a statutory demand for on June 17, requiring the alleged debt be paid within 21 days of service. According to the court documents, General Pants Co failed to comply with the demand, with UCC Australia seeking a court order for a liquidator to be appointed to the company. The matter has been listed before a Judicial Registrar on August 20. But in a two-page response filed with the court on July 24, lawyers acting for General Pants Co signalled their intention to appear at the hearing and oppose the application. The response claims the company opposes the application because the company is solvent and has paid UCC Australia’s debt. General Pants Co has been a staple in Australian fashion for more than 50 years and has 55 stores across Australia and New Zealand. UCC is an importer, distributor and wholesaler of FMCG, supplying electricals and food to some of Australia’s major retailers, including Myer, Big W, Kmart, Woolworths and Amazon. Online grocery shoppers were hit with unexpected duplicate charges weeks after their Coles deliveries were completed, with the company apologising.

Labor Mayor Ola Hamed was forced to call a 15-minute adjournment during Cumberland City Council’s meeting on Wednesday night after the shocking row exploded between Ahmed Ouf and Diane Colman, who leapt to her feet and screamed, “You cannot speak to me like that!” Cr Ouf, an independent, was speaking in support of a motion about the city’s 2026 Easter Extravaganza nearly two hours into the meeting, when he hit out at apparent interjections from the Labor councillor. “Can you just shut up when I’m talking, OK?” Cr Ouf snapped. “I beg your pardon, Councillor,” Mayor Hamed interjected. “When I’m talking this is my time, not your time,” Cr Ouf told Cr Colman. “When I talk, you shut up, OK?” “Oh, point of order, Mayor, point of order!” Cr Colman called out. Cr Ouf asked, “Why is she talking while I’m talking? Why is she taking from my time?” Cr Colman yelled back across the chamber, “How dare you!” Cr Ouf hit back, “You just keep your mouth shut while I’m talking. I never, ever spoke when you were talking or having time.” At that point Cr Colman leapt to her feet and exploded. “You cannot speak to me like that!” she screamed. “You show respect! You show respect!” Cr Ouf yelled back. “You show me some respect!” Cr Colman went on. “How dare you speak to me like that! How dare you!” Cr Ouf said he was “not intimidated, not 100 of you”. Cr Colman screamed again, “How dare you? Who you think you’re speaking to?” Cr Ouf told her, “Then show respect so you can be respected. When I’m talking, you stay shut.” Mayor Hamed then called an adjournment. “This isn’t the first time women councillors have been publicly disrespected at Cumberland Council, as you can see by my reaction,” Cr Colman told news.com.au on Friday. “There’s been a pattern of bad behaviour towards women on our council for a very long time.” She noted that a 2023 survey by the Australian Local Government Women’s Association (ALGWA), where she sits on the board, found 61 per cent of female councillors had experienced bullying and harassment. “This is a direct demonstration of the misogyny that’s endemic in our society,” she said. “For too long women in leadership have had to put up with it.” Cr Colman said there were “three or four people” who had attempted to correct a comment by Cr Ouf but “he singled me out”. “I was very shocked because I’ve never had anything but cordial dealings with Cr Ouf,” she said. “I think he really showed his true colours.” Cr Ouf insisted that it “has nothing to do with gender, the get-out-of-jail-free card which is misogyny”. He conceded he “should have used another word” but said his comment to “shut up” was “in the heat of the moment”. “She started interrupting me, harassing me while I’m speaking,” he told news.com.au. “All I wanted was just let me speak, respect me, I respect you, give me my time, do not interrupt. This has nothing to do with skin colour or gender. If she did not interrupt me or harass me I would not have done what I’ve done. You can go back to my record, I’ve never interrupted or harassed any of my colleagues trying to cut them down.” Cr Ouf added he was interrupted “while speaking on behalf of a minority”, the religious group Falun Dafa, who experience persecution in China. He said a Falun Dafa woman who was present, the only member of the public in the gallery, was left in tears by the scene. “I support everyone, I love everyone, I respect everyone,” he said. Libertarian Councillor Steve Christou, who shared a viral clip of the blow-up on social media, has sided with Cr Ouf. He claimed Cr Colman “was interjecting during his speech”. “Mind you, no one was interjecting Cr Colman all night,” he told news.com.au. “I’ve previously had run-ins before with Cr Colman interjecting [during] my speeches. Yes, Ahmed told her to shut up in frustration, but Cr Colman had a meltdown of epic proportions. It continued after the camera went off. Quite frankly it created a very unhealthy and unsafe workplace environment, not just for councillors but for the poor staff who had to witness this behaviour and work through it.” Cr Christou said it was unclear exactly what the alleged interjections were about. “She was making some kind of remarks, they were a bit inaudible,” he said. “She claims she was trying to correct him on something he had stated. He was speaking on the Easter motion but then he turned his attention to Falun Dafa and whether we should acknowledge it in Cumberland or not. I think he was questioned on ‘why are you raising Falun Dafa’. But she was interjecting, speaking while he was speaking. In all honesty you can’t just stir something up and instigate an issue and then claim misogyny.” Cr Christou said in “any other workplace there would have been disciplinary action and instant dismissal”. “This needs to be looked into, you can’t rug pull it, someone has to speak up,” he said. “I’ve previously raised concerns about behaviours. At some point, just because you’re in the public sphere doesn’t mean you get a free pass to do what you want. No other workplace would tolerate this type of behaviour.” Cr Christou said Cumberland ratepayers “deserve better”, particularly after a 7.1 per cent rate hike last month.

    "content": "A beloved boutique chocolate retailer is battling through a whopping rise in global cocoa prices, but Australia’s sweet tooth is helping out. A popular Aussie chocolatier is battling to “survive” amid a dramatic rise in cocoa prices, but Australia’s renowned sweet tooth might help it through the storm. Bruce and Joanne Nethercote, the owners of boutique Melbourne chocolate seller Chocilo, say they will raise prices on their products twice this year to match the wild upward swing in cocoa prices over the past two years. Cocoa is the main input ingredient in chocolate. “We’ve never had two price increases in a year, which we are doing this year,” Mr Nethercote told NewsWire this week. “It’s always been one (increase). For a small business, it’s always a little unnerving to put your product up a couple time of year, but we just have to or we won’t survive.” Supply shocks in northwest Africa, the prime growing zone for cocoa, sent prices soaring from around $US3000 a tonne at the beginning of 2023 to more than $US10,000 a tonne in 2024. “It’s settled down a little, but it will never go back,” Mr Nethercote said. “That has been the biggest direct impact on us.” Chocilo buys chocolate in bulk and then crafts it into its own boutique products, like a pinata-esque offering called a “chocolate smash cake”. The big dome of chocolate is filled with lollies inside and people smash it at parties like children hitting a pinata, Ms Nethercote said. Australia’s sweet tooth has helped the business chug along, even as cocoa, freight, labour and packaging costs all rise. “People still want to treat themselves,” Ms Nethercote said. “They probably don’t spend as much on themselves as they used to, but it’s a treat for the parents to come in with their kids and buy a little dinosaur chocolate, spend $5 or $6.” The small operators aren’t the only ones increasing prices in response to the cocoa tsunami. In its latest sales results from April, chocolate giant Nestle reported it had lifted prices 2.1 per cent to “address input cost inflation in coffee and cocoa-related categories”. “Despite the significant level of the increases in many markets, the actions were implemented with limited customer disruption,” the company said. Looking forward, the Nethercotes, both aged 57, said it was time for the business to “hunker down and consolidate”. “We’ve been quite lucky in some regards, but it’s been the right time at the right place with the right structure in place,” Mr Nethercote said. “We’ve still got growth. Our boutique Chocilo brand is still growing, from an online and wholesale perspective. We’re still increasing there. “It’s just the dynamics, or the type of product that the end consumer is really purchasing that has changed a little bit.” There are also some gathering tailwinds for Australia’s small businesses in the near term. “We expect the business outlook to improve as strong labour market conditions and lower interest rates encourage consumers to spend and in turn help businesses grow,” ANZ economist Adelaide Timbrell told NewsWire this week. Online grocery shoppers were hit with unexpected duplicate charges weeks after their Coles deliveries were completed, with the company apologising. A well-known Australian fashion chain has revealed it will fight a push to appoint liquidators after it was hit with legal action over alleged debts. End-of-financial-year sales and Australians flocking to one electrical item have triggered an unexpected retail boom. Our Apps",

    "content": "While Australia dodged the worst of America’s trade war, experts warn the fallout will still impact everything from mortgages to medicine costs. Australia may have avoided the worst of the US tariffs, but it is still likely to impact every household in a few key ways. Starting August 1, US trading partners faced a wave of fresh levies. US President Donald Trump signed in higher rates for many countries under a new executive order, but so far has left the original baseline tariffs at 10 per cent. Australia does not have an additional “reciprocal tariff” and only faces the base rate. AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said while Australia would not be directly impacted, there would be second order impacts. “It is good news for Australian companies but the threat to global growth remains significant,” Dr Oliver said. “The average tariff rate is 20 per cent …. well up from the two to three per cent tariff going to the US at the start of the year. “There is going to be a hit to the US economic growth and global growth as there is a big increase compared to last year.” This slowdown is the biggest threat to the Australian economy. Interest rate In a win for mortgage holders and a loss for savers, the fallout from Trump’s tariffs could see interest rates cut further than previously anticipated. Dr Oliver said on the back of slowing economic growth households with a mortgage could benefit from lower rates. “It won’t push prices up in Australia …. if anything, the weaker economic growth environment that might unfold could mean less inflation,” he told NewsWire. “But there is this perverse thing because of the uncertainty imposed on global growth. “It could mean lower than otherwise interest rates and households with mortgages will benefit from that.” The RBA minutes from July showed while interest rates were kept on hold, the board was already debating the impact of Trump’s tariffs. The minority in favour of a cut argued that US tariff policy would be a drag on future global economic growth, Australia’s economy is subdued, household spending was weak and the economy lost momentum. “Uncertainty in the world economy remained pronounced and the material increase in US tariffs – even if not as extreme as had been announced in early April – would be a drag on future growth abroad, and thereby domestic economic activity and inflation,” the minutes of the RBA’s monetary policy meeting said. Jobs market While interest rate falls could help mortgage holders, the same economic fallout could smash the Australian jobs market. In its latest release of jobs data, the ABS revealed Australia’s unemployment rate jumped to 4.3 per cent — its highest level since the post pandemic recovery. Still, it remains lower than the long term average. Dr Oliver also said Australians might find the overall economic market tougher in the foreseeable future, which would impact jobs. “If global growth is weaker that means less demand for our exports, less national income which could adversely affect economic growth in Australia, which could mean the jobs market may not be as strong as it has been,” he said. “It might be a tougher economic environment generally for Australians meaning it's a little bit harder to get a job.” Superannuation Investments in shares and superannuation are tipped to be more volatile, although it is unlikely to see the same dramatic drop as the post “Liberation day falls”. When the tariffs were first announced on April 7, the ASX 200 wiped almost $110bn off as it fell by 4.2 per cent. The market eventually fell to a low point of 7169 points before rallying 22 per cent to the end of July. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said currently the market reaction was “subdued” to the tariffs, with investors learning tariffs could be negotiated. “The combination of these factors has kept market volatility low at this point of time,” Mr Sycamore said. “What could change this situation, is retaliatory tariffs from impacted countries, which in turn could lead to higher tariffs from the US than the ones announced this morning.” Meat and livestock Australian beef producers are so far the surprising winner out of Mr Trump’s crackdown on imports, as limited stock and a lack of supply sees Australia emerge as the last man standing. Commonwealth Bank sustainable and agricultural economist Dennis Voznesenski previously told NewsWire strong demand out of the US would continue to support new all-time highs. “The US has largely four sources to import beef from abroad, being Mexico, Canada, Brazil and Australia,” Mr Voznesenski said. “Mexico has a flesh eating bacteria called new age screw worm with the US closing the border to Mexico … Canada exports to the US are down 25 per cent from last year as they rebuild stock and as of August 1 President Trump plans to put a 50 per cent tariff on Brazil.” The economist said US farmers currently had a multiple-decade low supply of beef, meaning they will need to continue to export from other countries. “Typically with tariffs the objective is to the onshore industry. With some products you can restart quickly, but with cattle it’s just not how it works, “ Mr Voznesenski said. Buying medicines Australians as a whole could be paying more for medicines as the US President took aim at “foreign freeloading nations.” In a group, which alluded to Australia’s pharmaceutical benefit schemes, Mr Trump issued a letter to the bosses of 17 drug firms on Thursday demanding they extend “most favoured nation” pricing to the US. “Domestic MFN pricing will require you, and all manufacturers, to negotiate harder with foreign freeloading nations,” Mr Trump wrote in the letters. “US trade policy will endeavour to support this. However, increased revenues abroad must be repatriated to lower drug prices for American patients and taxpayers through an explicit agreement with the United States.” While pointing out the full impact was currently unknown, Dr Oliver said it was conceivable individual Australians or the government would have to pay more for medicines. Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said. Following revelations espionage costs the Australian economy billions a year, the Home Affairs Minister says people need to take personal responsibility. Property prices have defied interest rate pressures to reach a high, with regional areas outperforming capital cities across most markets. Our Apps",

    "content": "A fresh warning bell is ringing for the Aussie economy, with one analyst saying the country has entered a “flat patch”. Business revenues declined in May for the first time since late 2024 in a fresh warning bell for Australia’s stumbling economy. The Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed the dip in its latest data release on business turnover, which covers total income generated from sales before taking out expenses. A slump in arts and recreation services propelled the decline, with the category tumbling 5.5 per cent over the month. Manufacturing declined 1.3 per cent and retail slipped 0.8 per cent. Altogether, turnover in five of 13 industries fell. “This is the first fall in monthly business turnover since October 2024,” ABS head of business statistics Robert Ewing said. “Softening the fall, we saw rises in electricity, gas, water and waste services, up 1.7 per cent, and wholesale trade, up 1.1 per cent.” IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said May’s numbers suggested Australia’s economy had entered a “flat patch”. “It supports other data that indicates the economy remains in a flat patch, with the softness in retail sales confirming the idea that households remain cautious,” he said. “This reinforces the need for additional monetary policy easing from the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) to boost sentiment and growth prospects for the Australian economy into the end of 2025.” Compared with May 2024, however, overall turnover was 3.3 per cent higher for the month, the ABS said. May’s dip follows a shock decision from the RBA on Tuesday to hold the cash rate at 3.85 per cent, defying expectations from expert commentators and the money markets. RBA governor Michele Bullock wanted to wait for the June quarter inflation numbers – scheduled for release on July 20 – before moving on rates. “We just want to confirm with a full quarterly CPI that we’re still on track to deliver inflation continuing down to the middle of the band over time,” she said in response to a question from NewsWire. “That’s the reason we’re waiting. We decided to hold and we’ll reconsider again in August with this extra information and new forecasts.” bRight Agent co-founder Aaron Scott called the hold a “cruel blow” for millions of Australian homeowners. “Despite the fact that a July cut would not have been enough to give most mortgage holders a meaningful reprieve, it would have been welcome by the millions of Aussies who are holding out for more cost-of-living relief,” he said on Tuesday. “Nobody will be breaking out the Wagyu beef or shiraz.” On Thursday, banking giant Commonwealth Bank also warned that households remained cautious. “While we still anticipate a pick-up in household spending in 2025, a slower rate-cutting cycle could soften this recovery over the remainder of the year,” CBA senior economist Belinda Allen said. Consumer spending lifted 0.3 per cent in June, the bank’s closely watched household spending index revealed, for a third month of gains following rises of 0.4 per cent in both April and May. Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said.

    "content": "A young Aussie has issued a stark warning after revealing how much debt she is in from just one semester at university. A young Aussie has slammed indexation and the pressure to attend university, claiming her HECS-HELP debt has tripled since she dropped out. Clio Crowhurst, 22, attended university to study nursing for one semester when she was 18 but dropped out because she wasn’t passionate enough about it as a career path. “I couldn’t see myself working in a career where my heart wasn’t fully in it,” she told news.com.au. Even though her university education lasted less than half a year, she’s still paying for it four years later. “When I left university after a semester, (my debt) was around $2000. To see it more than triple due to indexation is honestly confronting,” Ms Crowhurst said. The $2000 debt has ballooned now to around $7000, a reality she finds maddening and unfair. “Don’t go to uni if you don’t know what you want to do. You’re going to be in so much debt,” she warned. The 22-year-old stressed she has zero issues with the fact degrees cost money but the indexation is what she takes issue with. “Before indexation, I wouldn’t have said it felt unreasonable. But now? Yes. I only studied for one semester, and I’m unable to use any of the skills I learned,” she said. Higher education loans in Australia don’t charge interest, but they are subject to indexation based on inflation. In 2023, millions of Australians saw their loans increase by a whopping 7.1 per cent — the biggest jump seen in 30 years. In June 2024, the indexation rate was 4.7 per cent. HECS-HELP loans are now indexed in line with either the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price Index (WPI), depending on which figure is smaller, with this change backdated to June 1, 2023. On June 1, 2025, a 3.2 per cent indexation was applied to all student loan debts. However, on Thursday, reforms passed parliament that will see student loan debts slashed by 20 per cent for approximately three million graduates. Ms Crowhurst explained that she had always felt “pressured” to go to university because it was all she had ever heard her teachers and peers talk about. “We are so wired at school to focus on our ATAR, which then intern makes us focus on what we’re going use our ATAR for in uni,” she said. She never felt hassled by her parents about getting a higher education but she feels, in general, there’s so much pressure on young people to finish high school and go straight to university. “It is such a big decision to take on a degree straight out of school,” she argued. “I’d honestly encourage (young people) to work in an area they’re curious about or even take time to travel. “There’s no rush, follow your heart before committing to something just because it is expected.” She believes that, if she had put more thought into enrolling in university and understood indexation, she might have made a different choice. “I’m mostly regretful that I didn’t fully understand the long-term implications of HECS debt at the time,” she said. “In high school, we weren’t taught how debt, interest, or indexation work. I wish there had been more education around real-world financial literacy, things like tax, credit scores, and loan systems.” Ms Crowhurst added that 18-year-olds are trusted to make “lifelong decisions” with “very little real-world context”, and she didn’t feel she was set up with the tools to navigate things like university confidently. It also stings that she hasn’t used practically anything she learned during her short time at university. “I remember a few health-related facts, but nothing I apply in day-to-day life,” the 22-year-old said. “I now work professionally as a content creator, PR consultant, and social media manager. Looking back, the degree wasn’t worth it for me personally, but I don’t think that’s a reflection of the field. “It’s more a reflection of how quickly many young people are expected to make huge decisions without the support or education to do so wisely.” Millions of Australians will have thousands of dollars slashed from their student debt after parliament passed new laws on Thursday. Here’s what you’ll get – and when. The shocking sum some Aussies are having to cough up because of return to office mandates has finally been revealed. Two videos have revealed a very bleak situation facing young Australians right now - and they are well and truly fed up. Our Apps",

The benchmark ASX 200 closed lower on Thursday dropping 27.80 points or 0.32 per cent to 8,709.40 points while the broader All Ordinaries slipped 22 points or 02.4 per cent to 8,979.40. The Aussie dollar jumped 0.19 per cent and is now buying 66.11 US cents. All sectors except health care closed in the red, with the falls led by industrials, property, consumer discretionary and energy stocks. Market heavyweight CSL gained 1.53 per cent to $269.56, while ResMed gained 0.44 per cent to $41.10 and Cochlear closed 0.03 per cent higher to $314.01. Three of the four major banks also finished in the green, despite the sector as a whole falling. CBA eked out a 0.10 per cent gain to $173.47, NAB jumped 1.24 per cent to $37.66 and Westpac finished 0.54 per cent higher to $33.29. ANZ was the outlier sliding 0.43 per cent to $30.44. After jumping on the opening bell, shares subsequently fell after RBA governor Michele Bullock made her speech at the Annika Foundation lunch. IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said the market’s confidence in a rate cut in August slipped after the speech. “The RBA governor has elected to look through the recent criticism and, in her speech, downplayed the rise in employment saying it wasn’t a surprise,” he wrote in a market note. “She also noted that monthly inflation data suggests the inflation rate may not fall as fast as forecast in May.” Following Ms Bullock’s speech the markets knocked off about five basis points or RBA rate cuts by the end of the year. In company news earnings results disappointed on Thursday. Macquarie shares dived 5.08 per cent to $213.84 after telling the market longstanding chief financial officer Alex Harvey will retire mid-2026 as well as announcing its first quarter data. Macquarie, which is broken up into four business segments, said its banking and financial services and Macquarie capital improved performance over the three months until June 30. But its Macquarie Asset Management and Commodities and Global Markets segments slipped. Overall Macquarie Group reported a $3.7bn profit for FY25. It was also a disappointing trading update for Bapcor with shares slumping to a five-year low after the Autobarn and Midas owner said statutory net profits after tax would lie between $31 to $34m. Shares in the company slumped 28.38 per cent to $3.66 on the announcement. In a positive trading update Fortescue shares jumped 4.34 per cent to $19 after the investing giant announced its fourth quarter update showing it shipped a record-breaking annual shipment of 198.4Mt in FY 2025. Lynas Rare Earths gained 5.03 per cent to $10.65 after its shipment jumped 38 per cent compared to the prior quarter. To join the conversation, please log in. Don't have an account?

    "content": "Donald Trump personally ensured Australia’s tariff rate would remain at 10pc, despite “pressure” from inside his administration, the Trade Minister has said. Donald Trump personally called for Australia to keep its baseline 10 per cent tariff rate despite “some pressure in the American system,” Trade Minister Don Farrell has said. Australia was just one of the few countries to not be hit by steeper tariffs after the extended deadline for negotiations lapsed on Friday. Senator Farrell said this was “vindication” for Labor’s “cool and calm negotiations”. He said discussions with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed the steady rate, despite lobbying from other parts of the Trump administration. “He indicated there had been some pressure on the American system for an increase, but that President Trump had decided to maintain that 10 per cent,” he said. “I think this is a vindication for the Albanese government, and particularly the Prime Minister, in the cool and calm way we have conducted diplomacy with the United States.” He said that Australia having one of the lowest baseline tariff rates would make Australian products not just more competitive in the US market, but it would also promote trade with other countries too. “What this decision means in conjunction with all of the other changes to other countries is that Australian products are now more competitive into the American market,” he said. “This means product like wine, beef, lamb, wheat, in a relative sense, are cheaper (when sold) into the United States. “As a government, we will assist all of our exporters in ensuring we take advantage of this situation and increase the volume of exports, not just to the US, but all of those other countries that we have diversified with.” Senator Farrell said Australia would continue to advocate for a tariff exemption, adding that Mr Lutnick had been invited to Australia to continue talks. “We believe in free and fair trade, and we will continue to put the argument to the US that they should remove all tariffs on Australian products in accordance with our free trade agreement, and we will continue to prosecute that argument,” he said. “I have invited Secretary Lutnick to come to Australia to continue the discussions.” Australia’s defence pact AUKUS will still be discussed separately from trade, with Senator Farrell saying he was confident the US would continue with the agreement. This is despite AUKUS sceptic Elbridge Colby currently conducting a review into the deal, currently set to be completed in the next two to four months. Countries get hit with tariff hikes On Friday, Mr Trump signed in higher rates for many countries under a new executive order, but the tariff on Australian imports will remain at the original baseline of 10 per cent. The US leader had earlier threatened to increase tariffs on Australia to 15 or 20 per cent. In a statement from Thursday morning, the Whitehouse said President Trump had decided to “adjust” his “reciprocal” tariff regime, first announced on April 2, in response to trade negotiations with individual countries. “Several countries have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade deals and security agreements with the United States,” the statements reads. “Some countries, through negotiations, have offered terms that, in the President’s judgment, do not sufficiently address the national emergency he declared on April 2. “Some countries have not negotiated at all with the United States. “Based on this additional information and recommendations from senior officials, among other things, the President has determined that it is necessary and appropriate to modify the reciprocal tariff rates for certain countries.” The Whitehouse then lists a set of countries under “Annex 1”, with individual tariff rates set out for each nation. “Countries not listed in Annex I will be subject to a 10 per cent tariff,” the Whitehouse said. Australia is not included in Annex 1. Several countries, including ostensible US allies, now face steeper import duties. Canada has been whacked with a higher 35 per cent tariff, a move up from its original 25 per cent hit. Taiwan, a key US ally in Asia, faces a 20 per cent rate. Small nations with tiny economies have also been slammed. The Pacific country of Vanuatu, with a population of some 330,000, faces a 15 per cent tariff, while Laos has copped a 40 per cent tariff blow. A tariff is a tax placed on imports and steep tariffs can effectively cripple exports. The hold at 10 per cent is likely to engender relief in Australian business and political circles. However Coalition trade spokesman Kevin Hogan said it was “very disappointing” Australia wasn’t given advanced notice of Mr Trump’s decision ahead of Friday’s announcement. Mr Hogan said this was because Anthony Albanese had not “prioritised the relationship” with Mr Trump, with the pair yet to meet in person. A potential face-to-face could occur during the Quad meeting in India or during a trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, both in September. While Senator Farrell should not second-guess when a future meeting would occur he said these will happen at “the appropriate time”. “Obviously, this decision by the United States government is a very positive one for our relationship,” he said. Aus’ tariff reprieve follows US beef change The hold comes one week after the Albanese government agreed to allow beef imports from North America into the domestic market. The government denied the timing of the decision had anything to do with drawn-out tariff exemption talks with the US. Cattle producers have flagged biosecurity risks to the move, but the government insists beef sourced from Canada and Mexico and processed in the US would be safe. “It was not a trade decision … the American systems were assessed by our independent officials over the last several months and found to be up to scratch,” Health Minister Mark Butler said. IG markets analyst Tony Sycamore said the initial market reaction to news had been “relatively subdued”, but retaliatory tariffs from impacted countries could trigger volatility. “Market reactions to the newly announced tariffs have been relatively subdued, largely due to recent trade agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea and others that have mitigated their impact,” he said. “What could change this situation, is retaliatory tariffs from impacted countries which in turn could lead to higher tariffs from the US than the ones announced this morning.” Government staff in one Aussie state who are looking down the barrel of mass job cuts have been left fuming following a video call update. While Australia dodged the worst of America’s trade war, experts warn the fallout will still impact everything from mortgages to medicine costs.

    "content": "Joseph Berriman was kidnapped, bashed, and left. Over a decade later, the young tradie has pulled off the unthinkable. Over a decade ago, property developer Joseph Berriman was kidnapped, bashed, and left for dead. At the time, he promised himself that if he survived, he was never going to take life for granted again. These days, he’s a multi-millionaire living the tradie dream; he even owns a jetski. However, reaching this level of success was far from an overnight win – it was a decade-long slog. Mr Berriman was raised in Newcastle, NSW, and ended up in Western Australia, working in the mines and determined to make something of himself. He’d grown up in a loving household, but his mother struggled to support him and his four siblings, working three jobs to make ends meet. It wasn’t that he ever considered himself unlucky, but he recalls wondering from a young age why he couldn’t afford the same things as most of his friends. “The hunger came from growing up with not much,” Mr Berriman told news.com.au. “I have the most beautiful parents but they just didn’t have much money.” He always knew that he wanted more Growing up, Mr Berriman always knew that he wanted the luxury of not worrying about money, but he didn’t end up going to university. At 14, he was kicked out of school. He was disinterested and would rather go surfing and hang out with his mates than be stuck in a classroom. “I remember my dad coming to the school and he was upset when he arrived, and after he said to me, ‘you can do whatever you want to do, but you’ve to stick to it,’ he explained.” Mr Berriman took the advice seriously. He moved to a small country town and got an apprenticeship as a carpenter. When he looks at his own nephews and nieces now, it seems unthinkable to imagine a 14-year-old striking out on their own, but even as a teenager he was driven. “I just really wanted to be a really good carpenter,” he said. The move to WA turned into a nightmare Mr Berriman finished his apprenticeship and moved to Western Australia to do a traineeship in order to become an underground driller. “I always wanted to educate myself and I wanted to get better at things and I wanted to learn,” he said. At the time, the move felt like the right decision. However, once he arrived, even though he didn’t mind the actual work, he found being so far away from everything and everyone really hard. “It was a pretty stagnant place. I wanted freedom to be able to surf and travel and I think I felt trapped,” he said. Looking back, Mr Berriman said that boredom played a role in his falling in with the “wrong crowd,” but he was also young and having fun like everyone else his age. Mr Berriman’s party boy stage ended in broken bones when he was mistaken for someone else in 2013, at this point a 20-year-old man. He was kidnapped by a gang of four men outside a tattoo parlour in Margaret River, bundled into his own car before being taken to bushland 4 kilometres from town. Here, he was beaten nearly to death. Mr Berriman doesn’t remember all the details, he’s not even sure if he wants to, but he does remember thinking he was going to die. “I was beaten and it was pretty traumatic. They thought I was someone else, and I remember being handcuffed to a tree and thinking, ‘this must be it’,” he said. He doesn’t know who, but someone came back and un-handcuffed him from the tree where he’d essentially left in a dire straights. “I remember them saying to me, ‘you’re a good person and we’re sorry but you’ve got to head’.” At that point, he had no idea where he was, but he forced himself to start walking, despite being in excruciating pain and having no clue where he was heading. “I was a mess,” he recalled. “I just remember walking through this bush and the first person that come across was an off- duty paramedic and she basically saved me.” The attack left him with a fractured leg, nose, and broken knuckles. He also needed stitches in the back of his head and rehabilitation. “The doctor didn’t know how I survived. They thought it was crazy that I lived through it,” he said. Mr Berriman moved back to Newcastle after the attack. He said he is only just now starting to comprehend what happened to him, over a decade later. “I just didn’t take it to be as serious as it was. I was like, ‘okay let’s just get on with it’,” he said. “I moved back to Newcastle and that was the moment that I thought, I have to go for it, and life isn’t meant to be taken for granted. “What happened to me was crazy, and I wanted to make something of myself, and it made me fearless.” Starting again after the brutal beating It was a lengthy process to recover; Mr Berriman couldn’t work for months and he needed to attend regular rehab and physiotherapy. He spent around a year couch surfing with family and friends, and remained focused on his physical and emotional recovery, but he was also directionless. By luck, he had a family friend who saw potential in him and was running a successful building company. Mr Berriman said the guy took him under his wing and told he was a “good kid”, putting a lot of faith in him. The man offered him a job as a carpenter at his construction company, where they were building houses. Here, Mr Berriman thrived. “I learned how to be professional, how to run teams, and he taught me some really valuable things when it comes to running teams and clients,” he said. He was earning between $50,000 $60,000 at the time, but it felt like a million bucks, and it was enough to get his life back on track. Mr Berriman said he really felt like things were turning around. He and his girlfriend rented a studio apartment together, booked a trip to Bali and was eager to feel like himself again. Then everything fell apart. “I remember receiving a phone call from the guy who owned the company, and he was like ‘Joey, you’ve got to return the ute, we’re shutting up shop’,” he said. “They ended up going bankrupt, and I was like nooo, just when we were starting to get ahead.” Starting a company with basically nothing Gutted and fed up with being at the mercy of someone else, Mr Berriman finally decided to start his own business. “I started my own company because I didn’t want to let anyone take control of my future,” he explained. His knee-jerk reaction was to cancel his holiday and focus on building his own company but a mate encouraged him to go on the holiday, and use it as motivation to be able to do both. Mr Berriman hit the ground running. He bought an old ute, had his cousin, a graphic designer, create a website and logos for him, and purchased some work shirts. “I just went out quoting,” he said. He didn’t really know what he was doing. He rang around old clients he’d had a relationship with before the company he worked for went bust and tried to scrounge up as many new clients as possible. By the time the holiday came around he’d done countless quotes but had zero jobs booked in. “I didn’t hear anything,” he admitted. He was panicked, but it was too late to cancel the trip, so he went and spent the bulk of the time panicking. “The last few days of the holiday I just felt sick to my stomach and had like $250 left in my bank account,” he said. Not wanting to burden his girlfriend with the worry, he tried to pretend everything was fine but she saw through it. By the time they landed back in Sydney, she was demanding to know what was wrong with him, and he knew he had to fess up. But just before he came clean about being broke, he decided he’d check his phone and see if perhaps anyone had called while he was away. At that point, even one person would have been a dream come true. “I opened up my phone at the airport in Sydney and the messages just started going off. I listened to the voicemails, and it was like, ‘Hey Joey, we’d love to go ahead with the quote’,” he said. Mr Berriman went from having nothing to having a successful business in a matter of days. “Clients started sending out deposits, and within 24 hours, there was $250,000 in my bank account,” he revealed. “In the first 12 months, I generated seven figures in profit.” Creating a $10 million plus empire The business became an incredible success story, but it wasn’t easy. “I had to learn really fast. I was a young guy and I was telling people older than me how to do their jobs,” Mr Berriman said. “I had to understand how to hire the right people and manage the right people who are experts in their fields.” Having such a demanding job was also tough. He was only 22 at the time, and while all his friends were still partying, he was running sites and managing men decades older than him. Eventually, he took some time away and went on a trip around Australia with his girlfriend, focusing on maintaining a better work-life balance. Ultimately, he left the business and dived into property development and he is now the director, founder and coach at Premier and Co, alongside his best mate and business partner, Dylan Nilsson” The business is an education and coaching company supporting construction business owners to achieve long-term success with the right structures and strategies in place. If it sounds like everything just fell into place after he went out on his own, Mr Berriman said that couldn’t be further from the truth. “There was a million trillions, ups and downs, and lows and wins,” he said. Today, Mr Berriman’s property development company is worth $10 million and he has personally made seven figures in profit. But even now, he still feels like he is in the middle of his journey, not at the end. “I think you’re forever learning in business,” he said. The biggest thing he has taken away from all his success is that it isn’t just enough to work hard and make plenty of money. “What are you’re doing it for?” he asked. If you can’t answer that question, Mr Berriman said no amount of success will be enough. A clever and hard-working Aussie has revealed the idea that left him “screaming” when he realised he’d pulled it off. A beloved boutique chocolate retailer is battling through a whopping rise in global cocoa prices, but Australia’s sweet tooth is helping out. A $150m childcare company has kept quiet on its response to the Joshua Brown allegations, even as other centres flag major changes. Our Apps",

    "content": "We live in a society that champions individualism, productivity and professional and financial success. At every turn we’re encouraged to do it all, which can make us worry that if we’re not being productive, what is our purpose?Across two years of research, including interviews with more than 60 perinatal health specialists and hundreds of mothers on the Australian Birth Stories podcast, we learned that most mothers enter postpartum with unrealistic expectations of themselves and their bodies. Some are left feeling purposeless and questioning their worth when the work of caring for a baby doesn’t fit with the narrative of a results-driven society.And so it’s helpful to flip the narrative and consider rest as the most productive thing you can do after birth. While pregnancy is the most ordinary of experiences, it is also absolutely extraordinary; it’s the longest, highest-energy expenditure task the human body performs.After that you deserve rest, you need rest and it’s important to remember that your body heals when it’s resting. In fact, making a full recovery from childbirth is dependent on rest. When you care for yourself in postpartum, you lay the foundation for your long-term health and wellbeing.When it comes to postpartum, especially if you’ve got older children, rest is only made possible through intention, preparation and support. There’s a lot of privilege associated with the opportunity to rest – access to a support network or the funds to pay for one – but it also requires you to value it and prioritise it. Understanding that there are different ways to rest, even when sleep is not something you can count on, can make that easier.1. Social restThis doesn’t mean cancelling all plans but rather considering how you feel in social situations and being aware of the effect people have on you. Social rest is choosing to spend time with people who support your intentions and bolster your energy, who fill your soul and make you feel good.Ultimately, you want your social interactions to be positive and meaningful rather than draining and obligatory. This is particularly pertinent in early postpartum when unwanted guests can become a hindrance, tiring you and your baby by overstaying their welcome, which will make you feel depleted and exhausted at an already overwhelming time.2. Mental restThe immediate period after birth is a mentally demanding phase of rapid learning. This focus and subsequent exhaustion is exacerbated by birth recovery, fogginess (often referred to as “baby brain”), sleep deprivation and learning to breastfeed (if you do so). It’s imperative to give your brain space to process what you’re learning so the lessons have time to sink in. To create this space be mindful of what else you’re consuming, especially advice from social media, as information overload can make it hard to be discerning.If you feel as though there are too many thoughts, ideas and questions in your head, write them down in a dot-point list: it helps you to find clarity and empties your head of distractions.3. Sensory restBecause you’re in a physiologically vulnerable and sensitive state, you want to be gentle with your whole self. Any stress, anxiety or concerns will rattle you more than they usually do. Calming music, warm baths, hot tea, cosy clothes and minimal screen time will help you stay grounded. Think of your postpartum bedroom and house as a cocoon; prepare it while you’re pregnant and you’ll really benefit from its comfort.You’ll also benefit from time alone where no one is touching you. Being “touched out” is a common experience in early motherhood and is particularly relevant if you have older children who can, understandably, need extra touch and reassurance. This may quickly feel sensorially overwhelming, so prioritising breaks – in the shower or bath, in your bedroom with the door closed – goes a long way to creating the physical space you need to feel settled.4. Physical restBeyond the passive physical rest of sleep, active rest such as lying horizontally as much as possible in the first few weeks after birth is a big step towards recovery. This allows your pelvic floor to heal from pregnancy and birth, which is important for your long-term health.Active rest also involves releasing obvious tension in your body. Moving your hips and legs in a way that feels good – yoga, massage – is recommended in postpartum to improve circulation. Likewise, performing gentle stretches of your upper body, neck and shoulders will release the tension you may experience while learning to breastfeed.If you’re breastfeeding, it can be really helpful to feed while lying on your side; this prevents your upper body from getting tense and won’t place unnecessary pressure on your pelvic floor and perineum. But if you’ve had a caesarean birth, lying on your side to feed can be painful for the first few weeks, so you may be more comfortable in a supported seated position.5. Emotional restTalking to your partner, birth support person or doula/midwife is important. We often have a lot to unpack after birth and it’s common to want to share how you felt in labour, the highs and lows of the experience, and how you feel now. This is really healthy: you’re letting go of your thoughts, processing them with empathetic listeners and considering how they make you feel. Emotional rest is the calm you feel when you can share your experience in an honest and authentic way. This is an edited extract from The Complete Guide to Postpartum (Murdoch Books; $39.99)",
    "summary": "Here is a 3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nMany mothers enter the postpartum period with unrealistic expectations of themselves and their bodies, leading to feelings of purposelessness and self-doubt. However, rest is actually the most productive thing a new mother can do after birth, as it allows her body to heal and lays the foundation for long-term health and wellbeing. To prioritize rest, new mothers often need to be intentional and seek support, which can be challenging due to societal pressures to be productive and the privileges associated with accessing care.",

    "content": "I have a stepmother who my brother and I really despise. She has made our relationship with our dad really hard, and has tried to stop him seeing us at points. She has resented us since we were little. My dad has recently admitted that he thinks she is jealous of us and has a lot of regret for the way we were treated in the past.The trouble lies in the fact that he has said if anything happens to him (ie if he dies first) we would need to make an effort with her will-wise, to ensure we were treated fairly, as he doesn’t quite trust she would do the right thing.It feels incredibly hard to acknowledge this and agree when he has essentially admitted he doesn’t trust her with his dying wish. I also find it really hard to deal with the fact he is finally acknowledging how cruel she has been, but still insists we have a relationship. It makes me think he’s a coward. I really want to bring this up to him, but have no idea how to say: “Do you not think you should reconsider your marriage, based on the way in which you have shown you don’t trust your wife, and believe she is jealous of your children?”Eleanor says: First non-philosophical thing: if you haven’t already, I think you should get legal advice about the will. Is it that he might die intestate, and he’s hoping you’ll all sort it out? Or has he made arrangements, but worries she might challenge them?Legal advice would clarify what can be done now to avoid a horrible tangle later. That’s hard – nobody likes to get into the details about their dad’s death. Or indeed their own. But it’ll be so much harder, emotionally and legally, if your first advice about a possible estate conflict only comes after he’s died.To your question. You said you weren’t sure how to say what you wanted to say. When we say “I can’t figure out how to say such-and-such”, I always think the answer is to just say the such-and-such. You wrote it: “Do you not think you should reconsider your marriage, based on the ways you don’t trust your wife, and believe she’s jealous of your children?”A heady thing to say, for sure. But it’s not the word choice that makes it heady. You’d be asking your dad why he’s still married. You can soften the phrasing, but it’s the content of that question that makes us flinch, not the way of asking it.More frightening still is the fact that he might have an answer. Through your (and my) eyes that question is almost rhetorical: why stay married to someone you don’t trust and who’s mean to your kids? However, the fact that they are still married and that he wants you to have a relationship with her means that, for him, there might well be an answer. He might have considerations on the other side of the scale that outweigh the fact that she’s mean to his kids.Maybe he likes her enough. Maybe he doesn’t want to be alone. Maybe he thinks he’s too old, he’s not willing to make the change. Maybe he thinks the conflicts between her and his kids aren’t his concern.Maybe what look like obvious dealbreakers to you are just some considerations among many for him.The point is, your real question for him might be an even bigger flinch. Not just “why won’t you act on your judgment?”, but “why isn’t it your judgment that you should leave?” It’s possible he has bona fide answers – things that, to him, are more important than the way she treats you.It is hard to say which would hurt more: him not being brave enough to act on what he values, or this being exactly what it looks like when he does. I truly don’t know which of these it is. I feel for you the same in both cases. I don’t know whether you should ask him either question out loud; I don’t know how conversations with him tend to go, or whether his answer would make you feel better.I do know that when someone isn’t acting on what they say they see, it isn’t always that they lack the courage of their convictions. Sometimes they’re showing us their convictions through inaction.Ask Eleanor a question",

The problem in recent years is my orgasm. When it arrives, it is a bit of a letdown. It happens extremely quickly and feels like a premature ejaculation, even though it has taken a long time to get there. It makes no difference whether I am on top and in charge of the pace or whether my wife is. How can I make my orgasms more enjoyable?Certain medications – whether prescription or over-the-counter – can change the nature of one’s orgasm, so consider whether the culprit could be in your medicine cabinet. If this is a possibility, you should consult with the prescribing physician to find out if there might be an alternative. Another element to investigate is whether your hormones might have something to do with it. For example, you might ask a doctor to look at your testosterone levels. Strong orgasms are fuelled partly by sex hormones such as testosterone, and an insufficiency could lead to the symptoms you are experiencing. Finally, I can tell that you are proud of your sexual prowess, but it might be a good idea to relax a bit on the expectations you set for yourself. A person usually has a better orgasm when they are able to let go of performance pressure. Try to focus simply on pleasure.

    "title": "A hero among hormones: why cortisol is something to celebrate rather than stress about",
    "author": "Joel Snape",
    "source": "The Guardian",
    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/27/a-hero-among-hormones-why-cortisol-is-something-to-celebrate-rather-than-stress-about",
    "published": "2025-08-01T05:31:02.935261+00:00",
    "content": "Of all the hormones produced by the body, cortisol is the most misunderstood. It’s essential to any number of biological processes, and yet commonly typecast as “the one to do with stress” – an evolutionary adaptation for different times, wildly unsuited to modern living, something to reduce with meditation, reset with ice baths or regulate with red-light therapy.Personal trainers will tell you to avoid long runs in case they result in “cortisol belly”, while influencers diagnose “cortisol face” as a sign of too much pressure in the office. To top it all, social media has recently seen the rise of the “cortisol cocktail” – a combination of coconut water, orange juice, salt, and lemon that TikTokers claim can reduce stress and help with weight loss.But how much of this has any kind of scientific validity – and is worrying about your cortisol levels doing you more harm than good?The first thing to understand is what cortisol is, and what it actually does: and yes, that does include helping to manage our response to external stressors. In situations that the body perceives as fight-or-flight, it helps the body to produce immediate energy – as well as suppressing non-essential functions such as digestion or repair (we’ll get to whether this is a bad thing or not shortly). “Cortisol plays a vital role in blood-sugar regulation, by prompting the liver to produce glucose and helping ensure a steady supply of fuel to the brain and body,” says Hannah Alderson, a nutritionist, hormone specialist and author of Everything I Know About Hormones. “It also helps modulate inflammation, keeping immune responses in check and preventing them from going into overdrive. It’s key in how we metabolise fat, protein and carbohydrate.” It also regulates blood pressure, can act as a mood buffer, and kicks in to help fight infection if we’re recovering from an acute illness. But one of its most vital roles is also its least talked-about.“It’s the hormone that gets us out of bed,” says Angela Clow, emeritus professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. “You get this burst of it in the morning, which is called the ‘cortisol awakening response’. That’s not a bad thing or a stress response – it’s the body’s way of waking up and promoting cognitive function. You’ve probably experienced a time when you have an early flight or a busy day ahead, and your body anticipates it and wakes you up without needing an alarm clock. That’s cortisol priming your brain to be more alert and more active, preparing you for the day ahead.”Research published earlier this year confirmed that cortisol is already increasing from its lowest point about three hours before you wake up – putting to rest any idea that getting up itself is stressful for the body, and suggesting instead that rising cortisol levels are part of what gets us ready for the day. Like every other higher organism on the planet, we’ve evolved to live in an environment that’s dark for (roughly) half of every day, and so our body needs a way to switch from restoration into activity, which seems to be one of cortisol’s key roles.“A very large proportion of the genes in your body are sensitive to cortisol,” says Stafford Lightman, a professor of medicine at Bristol Medical School and co-author on the recent research. “And so cortisol has a daily rhythm, and that daily rhythm regulates multiple genes in multiple tissues; in your brain, your liver and your immune system.”As part of this process, cortisol levels gradually decline throughout the day, with periodic bursts approximately every 90 minutes helping to maintain proper bodily function. This certainly isn’t a bad thing, but it does make gauging it difficult: you could take two measurements 30 minutes apart and get two wildly differing numbers. Under laboratory conditions, researchers take cortisol readings from blood or saliva multiple times a day to obtain a general picture of how volunteers’ levels fluctuate and respond to stressors. At-home tests are much less useful: if you’re only testing yourself once or twice a day, the only thing you might notice is that your levels are very high or very low.So what about the idea that the minor stresses of everyday life are constantly keeping our cortisol levels perilously high? One common characterisation of the way this might work is that our bodies, evolved to deal with sabre-tooth tiger attacks and flash floods, can’t easily distinguish between those sorts of immediate, physical threats and more psychological ones – an argument on the school run, say, or a nasty email from a client. Social stressors, the theory goes, can be insidious: they’re basically ever-present, especially if we’re prone to catastrophise, and if our bodies’ restorative systems switch themselves off every time we encounter them, we’ll never have time for rest and repair.In baboon troops – which are very social and hierarchical – this effect is visible, with the lower-pecking-order males suffering with worse immunity and shorter lifespans, as their fight-or-flight systems are constantly prioritised over the rest-and-digest ones. But baboon lives tend to be genuinely far more stressful than human ones – if you’re kicked out of the troop or can’t find a mate, you’re facing a genuine, near-immediate threat to your genes’ survival, rather than just feeling a bit put out. There’s speculation, of course, that our bodies can’t make this sort of distinction, and that we still internally respond to having our birthday forgotten at the office like we would to banishment on the savannah. But is that really true?As it turns out, probably not. To test the effect of short-term bursts of stress, psychologists have developed all sorts of unpleasant laboratory procedures – from cold-water immersion to problem-solving under time pressure, to the Trier Social Stress Test, where volunteers are tasked with delivering a speech and mental arithmetic task in front of an unresponsive panel of evaluators. And the effect isn’t as pronounced as you might have been led to believe.“Trying to stress a human is really difficult,” says Lightman. “Even plunging your hand into freezing-cold water has very little effect. If you’ve got a really important job interview that is going to govern the rest of your life, then yes, that’s probably going to be stressful. But it’s very subjective – some people, of course, actually like giving presentations in front of a crowd. With things like the Trier test, you might get a reaction the first time, and then you won’t again – just understanding what the test is about is enough to destroy the effect.”This means you’re unlikely to be suffering spikes in cortisol from the odd snippy Zoom call or altercation at the self-checkout – and, even if your body sees those situations as a threat to your wellbeing, there are other systems that kick in first. “It’s not just cortisol that goes up in stressful situations,” says Dr Thomas Upton, a clinical research fellow who also worked on the recent study. “There are other hormones – like catecholamines, your adrenaline and noradrenaline – that play key roles in the immediate part of the fight-or-flight response. This is what helps you ‘fight the lion’ and get yourself out of the situation, followed up by cortisol release if the stress is strong enough or long enough. What you’re feeling in a very stressful situation like a jump scare is a rush of adrenaline that makes your heart pound and your mouth go dry and all the rest of it.”Brief, short-term stress is probably not doing you any harm, then. But does this mean heightened cortisol becomes more of an issue when you’re continuously stressed over the long term – for instance, from worrying about a family problem or the mortgage – or even deliberately putting yourself through too many difficult workouts?“That’s a bit trickier,” says Prof Clow. “If you just have a short burst of perceived stress, you will have a little burst of cortisol. That’s fine: your body will speedily return to normal cortisol secretion. But if you’re chronically stressed, repeatedly getting these bursts, that can affect the regulation of your underlying circadian pattern, which is regulated by your biological clock. So that, instead of having a healthy dynamic pattern of cortisol secretion over each 24 hours, you get ‘flat-lining’, which is not able to regulate other processes adequately.”Constant stress, then, is probably bad for your cognitive function and health. But cortisol is unlikely to change how you look, unless there are larger problems at play. “If you had Cushing’s syndrome, which is a rare condition where cortisol levels in the body are very high, for example due to a tumour of the adrenal gland, then yes, you might gain extra weight around the stomach, or notice that your face becomes round and puffy,” says Niamh Martin, a professor of endocrinology at Imperial College London. “But that tends to be with very, very high cortisol levels.”And, while it’s true that something like a long run can elevate cortisol levels over the short term, that doesn’t mean there’s any need to ditch your plans for a new personal best. “Doing, say, a marathon is a massively stressful situation for the body,” says Upton. “You need a cortisol response in that situation, and there’s nothing wrong with it: if you didn’t have that response, the results would probably be terrible. You might actually die.”The good news, then, is that you can happily ignore the most outlandish advice about keeping cortisol in check with cocktails or cold plunges. Unless you’re suffering from a clear medical issue, you probably also don’t need to worry about how your cortisol’s changing on a daily or hourly basis. Several companies are working on methods for continuously monitoring cortisol levels as you go about your everyday life – but even these could do most people more harm than good. “Something that we’ve seen with glucose monitors is that they create a lot of ‘worried well’ people who put one on, have their breakfast and say, oh hell, my blood sugar’s gone up too much,” says Lightman. “And then they start worrying about doing all sorts of things and make themselves ill. If you’re an Olympic sprinter or something, continuous monitoring might be useful. But, among most people, there’s so much individual variation that the range we call ‘normal’ is huge.”There’s one more obvious question here, though: if cortisol isn’t the culprit, why does stress seem to go hand in hand with poor health, immune-system disruption and weight gain? “It’s very difficult to unpick,” says Martin. “For instance, many of us have a complex relationship with food – and there are behavioural reasons why we eat besides being hungry – so it’s easy to blame cortisol if we notice that we’re gaining weight, but it might also be that, because we’re stressed, we’re eating in a different way. Similarly, you might be having a tough time at work and that means you don’t have time to exercise, or you’re not sleeping well because you’re stressed and that’s negatively affecting your cortisol levels, rather than the relationship going the other way. Part of the issue is that we still don’t fully understand the chronic stresses that modern life involves and what their impact is on our bodies over a long period of time.”So what does all this mean for you and your life – stressful or otherwise? “I think the most evidence-backed approach is to treat cortisol as something like a bystander, rather than blaming it for any issues you’re having,” says Martin. “If you’re chronically stressed, that’s something to deal with for health reasons, but it’s not necessarily a question of artificially finding ways to keep your cortisol down – it’s more holistic than that. The most important thing is to look after yourself, rather than reaching for an expensive supplement or a cortisol cocktail or anything like that.”“There are a few things that seem to help keep cortisol well regulated,” says Clow. “The research suggests, for instance, that the earlier you wake – within reason – promotes a healthy and dynamic cortisol rhythm. So getting plenty of sleep and then getting up relatively early seems to be very good for you. There’s increasing evidence that night-time light exposure inhibits your melatonin secretion, which liberates cortisol and allows it to rise while you sleep.” It’s worth mentioning, though, that getting enough sleep – and on a regular schedule – might be more important.Physical exercise seems to keep cortisol well regulated but, if you can’t face the gym, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. “Gentle exercise, like walking, stretching or pilates, can regulate cortisol far better than an hour-long Hiit class on an empty stomach,” says Alderson. “Breath work is amazing and you can do it anywhere. Micromoments of joy are a lot simpler to weave in than grand gestures like week-long yoga retreats – and, even if they’re not directly affecting your cortisol, they matter more than people realise. A laugh, a hug, a walk in nature: this stuff really matters.”Finally, it’s important to remember that, even if modern living does occasionally nudge your hormones outside optimal levels, cortisol is on your side. Your body’s stress response to most things should be good for you. Try to get some exercise every day, sleep on a regular schedule, and eat as sensibly as you can. Don’t worry about the other stuff: you really don’t need the stress.",

However, cortisol plays a vital role in various biological processes, including blood-sugar regulation, energy production, and response to external stressors.

    "content": "Yvonne Hughes was 19, and attending the funeral of a friend with cystic fibrosis, when she realised: “Oh shit, I’m going to die of this.” She had met him during shared hospital stays in childhood, and although Hughes had always known she had CF, she had never understood her illness as terminal until that day in 1992, when she stood at the back of the crowded chapel in Glasgow. For three days afterwards, she couldn’t stop crying. “I had a kind of meltdown. That’s probably the first time I thought that this thing I had was going to kill me.”Over the next few months, Hughes, who was studying at the University of Glasgow, listened to her mum, dad and older sister chatting during family meals as if she was a ghost at the table. “I pulled back from them. I deliberately didn’t talk or include myself,” she says. “I wanted them to get used to sitting and chatting without me, so that when I died, they wouldn’t notice I wasn’t there.”It’s a harrowing responsibility for a teenager to take, but self-erasure must have felt like a way to pre-empt death, perhaps to resist it. When she was growing up, cystic fibrosis was considered “a childhood disease” – because about half of those diagnosed did not survive their teens. A genetic condition in which the body creates thick, sticky mucus, it makes digestion difficult, damages lung function and can lead to respiratory failure. It affects about 160,000 people globally.Now 52, and enjoying what she calls a “second chance” at life more than 30 years later, Hughes has emerged as a comedian. We are speaking on a video call before her one-hour show, Absolutely Riddled, which she is performing at the Edinburgh fringe, based on her experiences of living with the condition. “I want to be true to myself and my story,” she says. Why does she think she survived when so many didn’t?For most of her childhood, Hughes, who works as a community development worker in Renfrewshire, didn’t regard herself as struggling for survival. Her parents didn’t sit her down in childhood to explain her illness; she had been diagnosed at six weeks old. But there were hospital visits and tablets and eating often made her vomit. Gradually, she says, she “put together those two words, cystic and fibrosis, with something that I had”.At school, she kept her illness hidden, taking her medication at home. She was popular; joined the Brownies, then Guides. “I’m a very level-headed person, but I keep a lot in my mind. I remember when I was younger thinking: ‘There’s no point telling people about this because everyone is dealing with something. I’m nothing special.’ I just got on with it.”Roughly one in every 2,500 people are born with cystic fibrosis in the UK, Australia and the US. Hughes’s older sister does not have the illness and the family had no idea what it meant for their lives, or for Hughes herself.Only as she grew older did Hughes build a sense of the precariousness of her life. “My mum said to me: ‘We thought you were going to die, every day. We just didn’t know.’ It became their new normal to keep me alive.”If she got a chest infection, pleurisy or pneumonia, she would go into hospital, and over the years made friends on the CF ward, a fragile community. When the curtains were closed around a bed for a long time, Hughes and the other children knew not to go past. She reasoned with herself, to allay her fears: “People were dying around me but I put it down to: ‘Maybe they had a really bad infection, maybe they were worse than me.’” In childhood, she developed “a lot of level-headed thought processes around why those people died”.She found solace in the Cystic Fibrosis Trust magazine, and dreamed of attending one of the advertised camps. “Luckily, I didn’t,” she says, because in the early 1990s, scientists discovered that the camps were a hotbed for the spread of bacteria, present in the lungs and phlegm of children with CF. Many cross-infected each other, some with fatal consequences.Did Hughes struggle to accept that sense of herself, as both vulnerable and a threat? “Absolutely,” she says. Hospitals implemented a policy of segregation, according to bacteria carried. Hughes has the pseudomonas bacteria, and after her friend’s funeral in 1992, she stopped seeing people with cystic fibrosis in case they had different bacteria or bugs that might lead to cross-infection.She has stayed in touch by phone with one old friend. “We shared growing up in the hospital ward and I do love speaking to him.” But after that funeral, “I became reckless,” she says. “I thought: ‘Well, life’s for living. I’m just going to do what I want.’ I didn’t care very much for myself. I thought: ‘What’s the point?’ I spiralled.”Her 20s and 30s passed in a blur of “festivals, partying, travelling when I could, flying by the seat of my pants … ” She had hoped to meet someone, and to have children. “I thought it would happen. And it never did.” In her 30s, her lung function got so low – 45%, then 36% – that she wouldn’t have been able to sustain a pregnancy anyway. “That was something I tried to grieve. But over the course of a year, I thought: ‘I’d rather be alive.’ My mantra became: ‘I’d rather have a full and short life than a long and unhappy one.’ These kinds of philosophical things got me through.”Hughes doesn’t have a mantra now – “other than trying to be funny”. The frequency of her performances range from three times a week to every few weeks, depending on her health needs. But even in her reckless phase, she embodied a stoicism, too. She worked throughout – at a call centre, a radio station, the CF Trust. “I just had to keep going, pay my bills and mortgage.”Did she ever wonder: “Why me?” She has had years of spitting out and swallowing mucus – “constant, constant” – hankies everywhere, non-stop sterilising of stuff, endless medication and pain, unable to take the next breath for granted. As a child, when she went into hospital, there was a faint sense of privilege at being given Lucozade and new slippers, things her sister didn’t get. But no one else in her family has the illness. Didn’t she feel aggrieved?“It’s a difficult question,” she says. “I’ve thought about ‘Why me?’ in a positive sense – that it was me because I could handle it. Or, I’m glad … because this has made me the way I am.” She has also thought, “Why at all? Why did cystic fibrosis come into being? Why have this weird disease that just kind of ruins lives?”While Hughes survived childhood by reminding herself that she wasn’t special, the differences between her life and others’ sharpened as she entered her 40s. She became an aunt, and bore close witness to her peers’ life transitions while she kept on being “just Yvonne – the one that never reached any potential”.“I couldn’t have a career because I would always get ill. I never moved social class. I always remained working class.” Her dad was a welder, her mother a GP receptionist. “Everything I did, I did myself. But it was day by day, week by week. There was never a plan. I always felt I could never get ahead of myself.”In 2018, aged 45, with deteriorating health, Hughes took redundancy from her job as public affairs officer at the CF Trust. Eating was difficult. Her weight hovered around 7 stone. She braced herself for the possibility of a lung transplant, but as her lung capacity dropped to 30%, she was deemed too ill for the waiting list. “I was like: ‘OK, that door’s closed. At this point, there isn’t anything else on the horizon to keep me alive.’” She completed an end-of-life form, and met the palliative care team. She thought: “I’ll see my days out with my parents, make memories and know I did well to get to 48.”Then, in 2020, the UK government granted access to a new drug, Kaftrio. Hughes had read about its worldwide trials. When the delivery driver knocked on the door, she told him: “You’re going to save my life.” At that point, her lung function was down to 26%.Within an hour or two of the first tablet, she started coughing. “They call it the purge,” she says. There was so much mucus – dark, watery and horribly fascinating – she captured it in a cup, put a lid on it, and stowed it in a drawer in her bedroom. “I kept that cup for a long time,” she says. Maybe she already knew it was a relic.The Kaftrio turned Hughes’s life “a whole 180, literally overnight”. There are side-effects – insomnia, weight gain, which have brought other challenges – but before long, she says, “I could breathe again without coughing. I went back to work within the year. I could run, I could dance, I could speak, I could stand up straight and cook. I used to always be bent over, catching my breath. And then all of a sudden that was gone. It was a miracle.”Energised, she decided to enrol in an evening course. Acrylic painting, maybe, or playing the keyboard? But at the University of Strathclyde’s Centre for Lifelong Learning, it was the flyer for comedy that caught her eye. “I had always loved going to gigs. Something clicked and I enrolled.”She performed a five-minute set for the course finale – and immediately wanted to do it again. “I started applying for clubs, Monkey Barrel and the Stand Comedy Club [both in Edinburgh]. I got Red Raw [the Stand’s beginners’ slot] and went from there. I want to change my life,” she says, “and I am doing comedy to see if I can change my life.”Nearly four years ago, Hughes met her partner, Alan, online. Having spent a lifetime feeling unable “to rely on a future”, she has had to learn to picture one – and to override her old instinct to absent herself to mitigate later losses. Sometimes, this means catching herself in the act of “pulling back” from Alan, and letting the pleasure she takes in his company teach her to quiet her mind.Life now is so different, it requires a conscious effort to remember how hard it was from one moment to the next. “I used to breathe so shallowly that I had to take a – haa! – sharp intake of breath – to feel I was breathing,” she says. The sound punctuated even the simplest actions – after getting into a car, for instance, after reaching for her seatbelt, after pulling it across her, after fastening it.“Now I can get in the car, pull the seatbelt over and go. I can walk and talk. I can laugh without wetting myself or going into a convulsion of coughing, pulling a muscle or breaking a rib,” she says. “It is a horrible, horrible disease. It suffocates you. It takes every inch of your breath away. And now it is something I can live with and not die from. I’ll probably live to get my pension.”Comedy has brought “fun, joy and laughter” back into Hughes’s life. But it has also given her something that nothing else has. “I had never found anything for me in my life. I’d never married. I had no children. So I had no community. Nothing,” she says. “There were people getting their careers and their lives sorted. Comedy was the one thing that was for me. And it still is. Just for me.” Yvonne Hughes: Absolutely Riddled is at Snug at Gilded Balloon Patter House, Edinburgh, until 15 August",

    "content": "Newcastle is on Awabakal and Worimi country. It has changed dramatically since I moved back here from Sydney in 2008. The cityscape is full of cranes with lots of new apartment blocks and hotels. The light rail is a newish, if controversial, addition and great coffee is everywhere.A lot more tourists come here now. In her memoir The Taste of Memory, the late, great writer Marion Halligan described Newcastle as “that well-kept secret of a place”. Well, the secret’s out!It’s such an easy place to live; everything is a 15-minute drive away. In October, an international terminal is opening at Newcastle airport with a direct flight to Bali up first. Everyone’s hoping for a bigger Asian destination next, so we can link up with Europe. That will be a game-changer for Newcastle.FoodMy top pick is the French-inspired Bistro Penny. It opened in 2024 in a heritage building in the inner city and it has ambience galore. It’s quite expensive but the classic Cafe de Paris steak is hard to beat. Book in advance for a weekend table.Humbug makes its own pasta and has a super interesting wine list. In summer, I love to stroll up from Newcastle beach and eat outdoors. From snacks to mains, it’s all good. Nagisa is a Japanese restaurant in Honeysuckle, right on the harbour. The sashimi, wagyu beef and dumplings are excellent and the banquets are perfect for a group.I salivate just thinking about Arno Deli’s paninis. The warm porchetta is my favourite – wintry and earthy with eggplant. It does cold salami or prosciutto paninis, too, and the cannoli is great. It’s in the CBD; expect a queue on weekends.Equium Social in Mayfield is serious about coffee but does excellent hot chocolate, loose-leaf native ingredient tea, housemade sodas and smoothies too.Cakeboi in Hamilton is owned by Reece Hignell, a baker who was on MasterChef. It has Newcastle’s best hot chocolate and good chai but you go for the cakes. My favourites are raspberry coconut cake, devil’s food cake, lemon tart and cinnamon scrolls.Sunnyboy Kiosk at Dixon Park beach is super local. Everyone raves about the coffee but I get a smoothie or a fresh juice. You pull up a plastic stool in front of the surf club among Newcastle Knights rugby players and a young beachy crew in gym wear.NatureThe historic Newcastle ocean baths are free, spectacular, close to a light rail stop and wheelchair-accessible. The concrete bleachers are painted a shade of teal that just screams art deco. You get everyone from boisterous teenagers to Newcastle’s top barristers. Some days the tide smashes over the wall and you see cormorants, osprey, sea eagles or whales. On hot nights people come to sit around or swim, and there’s lighting for evening dips.Bathers Way is a popular 6km walk from Merewether ocean baths in the south to Nobbys beach in the north. Keep walking around the harbour and you’ll pass the waterfront precinct Honeysuckle and reach Throsby Creek in Wickham. It was once heavily polluted but now there’s silvery fish leaping about, birdlife, mangroves and Newcastle Rowing Club uses it for their annual regatta. It’s a rewilding success story that proves community can fight for a space and make it something special.Hickson Street lookout in Merewether has a stunning view. Young people hang out here, eating takeaway. You can walk down to Burwood beach (beware, it’s unpatrolled) or challenge yourself with a hike or a bike through the Glenrock state conservation area.Stockton Bight sand dunes, in Worimi conservation lands, are famous. Murrook Adventures runs an all-terrain vehicle sand dune tour packed with cultural and ecological insights. It’s so good, I’ve done it twice.NightlifeNewcastle’s live music scene has gone backwards over the decades. There aren’t many venues left, but The Lass pub has long been a live music hotspot and the Stag & Hunter hotel gets some amazing Australian and international acts. Mad Poet in Newcastle West is newer and has a great wine list, hotdogs and tacos, and a small stage for live acts on Wednesday nights.Like most places, it’s the small bars and breweries that are booming these days. Bar Mellow on Hunter Street is in a beautiful ex-bank. It has cool booths and a nice vibe; I’d go for a negroni or a good glass of wine. Method Brewing in Islington is close to heaps of great restaurants on Beaumont Street and you can BYO food to the brewery.Romberg’s is my pick for a sophisticated cocktail with a view. It’s on the top floor of Crystalbrook Kingsley but it’s open to all.InspirationThe Lock-Up contemporary gallery in Newcastle’s historical precinct runs exhibitions, performances and classes. It’s in an 1800s police station and there’s still a padded cell inside. A lot of the art is site specific and responds to Australia’s colonial history. The curation is top-notch and recent artists have included Khaled Sabsabi and Locust Jones.Murrook culture centre is an amazing newish First Nations-run space in Port Stephens (20 minutes north). It leans heavily into interactive digital media and video; it’s quite unique. You can pick up some local Gathang language phrases in the cafe, which serves yapay djagil (house food) close to a peaceful billabong fringed by paperbark trees.The lighthouse at Whibayganba/Nobbys Head is an iconic symbol of Newcastle. There’s a beautiful walk along the breakwall there. It’s currently managed as Lighthouse Arts by Hunters Writers’ Centre and it has exhibitions on the weekend. The 360-degree view from the top is spectacular.Newcastle Art Gallery in Cooks Hill is reopening in late September in tandem with New Annual arts festival. The exhibition space will be doubled plus it’ll have a new cafe and shop.NeighbourhoodEclectic Newcastle East is my favourite place. You’ve got million-dollar ocean view apartments as well as housing commission units right there on the water. There’s ocean baths, cafes, parklands, cool restaurants and lots of heritage buildings. It’s next to the CBD but is about 300m from Newcastle beach – that’s pretty rare!Newcastle beach is the last light rail stop. From there, I recommend heading to Grain Store, in a former warehouse, for one of its many boutique beers. Or getting takeaway oysters or fish and chips from Scottie’s and eating them on the grass.Islington and Wickham are pretty gentrified suburbs but maintain an egalitarian, low-key feel. Slingtown in Carrington roasts its own coffee, while Yard Sale in Islington is an ethically minded store with both wardrobe and pantry staples. I buy all my presents at High Swan Dive. It’s like a nursery for millennials with indoor plants, nice pots and gardening tools. Islington park has a skate bowl, a playground and access to Throsby Creek.Darby Street in Cooks Hill is Newcastle’s best-known eat street. It has inner-Sydney vibes, terrace housing and the Delaney hotel. Goldbergs coffee house has been operating since 1995 and is the only spot open for coffee after 3pm. It’s a no-frills institution. I’m one of the regulars who has been coming for 25 years.AccommodationThe newest kid on the block is Little National hotel (from $180) in Newcastle West. It’s closest to the Newcastle Interchange light rail stop if you’re on the train from Sydney. The rooms are tight but people rave about the beds.Rydges Newcastle (from $200) is a bit old-school but the rooms are spacious and it’s right on the harbour. The bulk carrier ships glide past your window blowing that distinctive horn, and the path to the start of Bathers Way is right out the front.Crystalbrook Kingsley (from $234 per night) is in a mushroom-shaped building that’s very architecturally arresting. It has Romberg’s rooftop bar, a great restaurant called Roundhouse and a casual bar downstairs called Ms Marys. It’s close to the Darby Street precinct.It’s a five-minute ferry to Stockton Beach holiday park (from $38 for an unpowered tent site and $214 for a villa) or a good swimmer could make their own way. It’s alongside Stockton Bight sand dunes. Rosemarie Milsom is the founding director of Newcastle writers’ festival",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe city of Newcastle has undergone significant changes since 2008, with a surge in tourism, new developments, and improved infrastructure, including a light rail and international airport terminal. The city is now easily accessible and offers a great quality of life, with many amenities within a 15-minute drive. Newcastle is also a foodie's paradise, with top recommendations including Bistro Penny, Humbug, Nagisa, and Arno Deli, offering a range of cuisines from French to Italian and Japanese.",

    "content": "You need a break. It is very important, from time to time, to take a break from your partner, from your work, from your children, from your exercise, from your screens, from alcohol and drugs and therapy and podcasts and crisps. We need time and space to rest; this is a crucial part of a better life. This much is obvious.But we need to take breaks for less obvious reasons too.As any patient of psychodynamic psychotherapy or psychoanalysis knows, come July, therapists are banging on about their August break. You tell them a dream about losing your child in the supermarket; they interpret this as you feeling like a lost child because of the break. You talk about feeling angry at a friend who cancelled plans; they suggest you are feeling angry and abandoned because of the break. It’s outrageous and ridiculous – and most of the time, in my experience, absolutely true.I know this because I have fought off many of these kinds of interpretations over the years as a patient – and I still do sometimes. And I always try to understand the unconscious impact of my break as a therapist on my patients; because I know it cuts deep. Feeling left, excluded, disappointed, unwanted – nobody wants these emotions, but if you want to build a better life, you need to feel them, so they can find a home in your mind. Otherwise, this unwanted part of you ends up feeling abandoned and excluded twice over, and the emotions get locked down and stuck instead of understood and felt. When therapy is unboundaried and without breaks, the patient is robbed of this opportunity to grow.Over time, my daughter has thrived in her sense of separateness, in learning new things without meThe break is part of the treatment. Deeper change is made possible by the therapist’s absence and the patient’s survival of it. It hurts – but at least we don’t have to pay for that part.This is true of all relationships in life: separation is a prerequisite to growth. This came alive for me when I took my daughter to nursery for the first time. The pain and anxiety of leaving her felt almost unbearable for both of us – and that “almost” is important. Actually, it was bearable, after a settling-in period in which she could begin to feel safe in the nursery in my presence, and grow the capacity to tolerate my absence for longer and longer periods. Thanks to her keyworker’s sensitivity, understanding, care and hugs (for both of us), it was difficult and painful, but not a trauma. And, over time, my daughter has thrived in her sense of separateness, in having grown through a difficult experience, and in learning new things without me. In beginning to build her own life.For both our sakes, I had to let her go and learn to take breaks. Not only because I needed to rest. I also had to understand something about myself, which I think lies at the heart of a struggle that many of us experience. We don’t want to believe the fact that we are not indispensable, that our loved ones can survive without us, that they can manage. The conviction of the necessity of our constant availability is so compelling, we don’t believe life can go on when we aren’t there. And that makes sense; that’s how it often is at the beginning. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott said: “There is no such thing as a baby” – meaning, the baby simply cannot exist in the absence of maternal care (not only, but usually, provided by the mother).But as time goes on, and as babies grow up, separation has to become possible, and a child has to come to exist in the absence of the mother. And the same is true of friendships and romantic relationships. Nothing kills a friendship or sex life like long-term and unflinching dependence on one another with no time apart.For some, there are practicalities that make a break impossible. Parents and carers with children with disabilities who need additional care, for example, can struggle to secure the right kind of support that might make it possible for them to take a break of any kind. But the absolute necessity of these breaks is recognised in law (by the Children Act 1989 and the Breaks for Carers of Disabled Children Regulations 2011). So while I do understand that of course there may be external reasons why someone may not be able to take a break, that may make it even more important to find a way to do so.External reasons are probably not the only thing stopping us. The belief in the necessity of our constant presence protects us, unconsciously, from our awareness of our own limitations, of our vulnerabilities and needs. It protects us from the experience I had recently, of putting my daughter to bed earlier than usual and thinking, “What am I going to do with myself now?” and not knowing the answer. It can protect us from an empty feeling of not knowing ourselves, that we’ve been unconsciously filling up with all sorts of obligations and duties, which take us further away from what we truly need.So sometimes, in the interests of building a better life for you and your loved ones, taking a break really is the most important work you can do.That’s my story, and I’m sticking with it.

    "content": "Chantal Maher, a physiotherapy lecturer in Sydney, has a niggling life admin task on her mental to-do list. It has been on her mind for four years. “I’ve tried to do it twice, but because I got married and changed my name I had to do a change-of-name certificate. That delayed it further. It was like a whole other hurdle,” she says.The task is combining her two superannuation (pension) accounts, so that she only pays one admin fee. “It’s too annoying. There’s incentive as I’d save money, but finding time for it is another thing.”Mia Northrop, co-author of Life Admin Hacks, has encountered countless situations like this. She says people can get “stuck” in different stages of completing a task. “You might be really good at starting and really bad at finishing,” she says, or vice versa. “So you need to know this about yourself so that you can overcome the challenge.”When people struggle with admin, such as tax returns or creating a will, it can stem from fear of failure, Northrop says. “It’s tedious. It’s repetitive. It is often asking us to work on things that we are not particularly good at or confident about. That’s where a lot of procrastination can come into it because we aren’t particularly proficient, or we’re not passionate about it.”“Everyone procrastinates to some extent,” says clinical psychologist Dr Catherine Houlihan, from the University of the Sunshine Coast. “There’s a bit of stigma around it, because many people say it’s laziness or poor time management, and none of those things are true. It is actually a symptom of perfectionism.“When people have very high standards for themselves, and they worry about doing things perfectly … then, due to the standard not being met, guilt and shame and self-detrimental talk can come in.”  for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning There’s another reason Maher has put off her task – it seems harder than it needs to be. “I feel frustrated because I think [the companies] could make my life easier,” she says. “Part of me wonders if they make it deliberately awkward so we don’t do it.”Certain life admin tasks are irritating because you may only encounter them once. Associate Prof Micah Goldwater, a cognitive scientist at the University of Sydney, says we have to invest a lot of mental effort in learning new tasks. Then when we’re done, it “feels like there is very little use for it”.“With online forms there’s an initial block because … you’re having to learn how to use the specific form,” he says. “The functionality of all these forms is slightly different, and you have to be very detail-oriented and focused to work it out. Sometimes it seems like the trade-off isn’t worth it.”So what can a life-admin avoider do to tick off tedious tasks?Break it down into easier stepsNorthrop says she can’t get passionate about doing her tax return, so she created a checklist for herself – she ticks off sub-tasks throughout the year. “I have a folder where I save everything as I go so that when it comes to tax time, it’s not overwhelming.”Bribe yourselfHoulihan suggests incorporating rewards as you complete each stage. “Do one thing first and then pause and do something more enjoyable, have a break and go back to it,” she says. When Houlihan tackles an unpleasant task, she will break for “a pastry at a cafe, spending time in nature or watching the TV show I wanted to watch … a reward can help motivate us”.Find a buddyTelling other people what you plan to do can be helpful, says Northrop, but Houlihan says it can be controversial too. “You don’t want people to nag you,” Houlihan says. “That might give the tasks even more negative connotations” – which reinforces procrastination. “But if you say to someone that loves and cares about you ‘I want to do this by Friday’, it can help you hold yourself accountable.”The worse you feel about your ability to do a task, the less likely you’ll be to attempt it, and then the worse you’ll feel for not doing it. So choose your people wisely: “Not someone who is going to be on your back, or going to make you feel bad if you don’t do it.”Block out time“If there’s a task I have to do, rather than being on a vague to-do list, I put it into my calendar,” Goldwater says. Blocking off time in your day means it’s more likely to happen, he says. “Everything is in my calendar now. If it’s not on the calendar, I will most likely forget about it. Life admin tasks are one of those things.”Host a ‘forcing party’Combining accountability buddies with blocking out time, writer and educator Tyler Alterman found a novel way to beat procrastination. On X, he posted that throwing a “forcing party”, where he and his friends got together to do life admin they’d been avoiding, was a huge success. “A passport has been filed for, an inbox has been zero’d, a personal website has been created, & more,” he wrote.Create a calm spaceIf your environment is working against you, it might help to remove some of that friction, Northrop says. “Shut down distractions, turn off notifications, or listen to music that gets you in that flow state.”If you’re neurodivergent, “it’s extra challenging”, she adds. “There’s no silver bullet. It’s often a mixture of the physical environment and our own personality … I’ve had clients who have multiple children or health issues they’re having to accommodate, and there are only so many hours in the day.”Do the worst part first“If boring tasks sit at the end of your day or the end of your week, they’re probably looming in the back of your mind,” Houlihan says. “The anticipation of how unpleasant it will be grows and grows.“One quick tip is to flip your calendar upside down – start with the most boring things first and to get them out of the way.”Call in an expertSome life admin is incredibly convoluted and taxing. At this point, it’s worth considering engaging someone to help you navigate it, such as a social worker or solicitor.Ines Jusufspahic is an immigration lawyer in Sydney who works with individuals and companies to complete working visas and partner visas. “We take the angst out of it as much as possible,” the principal solicitor at Rocket & Ash Immigration Law says.Jusufspahic has had clients return to Brazil, Argentina and the UK: they had avoided the paperwork for so long, there wasn’t enough time to process their visas. “This is often the biggest problem in their life, and there’s often a time pressure,” she says. “It’s a process that people really dislike, and it’s really confusing for some people.”Houlihan says some people are chronic procrastinators, and the first step is recognising any patterns in your behaviour. “If you’ve still got that piece of paper on your table, then is that the only thing that’s still lying around?” she says. If it’s a widespread issue, and causing negative thoughts, a therapist can help you identify and work through the possible emotional triggers and understand why. “That’s really the key to what to do about it.”Do it later“I think we are often just being too hard on ourselves,” Houlihan says. “We can become trapped in a cycle of heightened stimulation and being on the go, especially if you have young children, and we can have this sense of urgency that we just apply to all tasks.“Actually take stock and think ‘Do I need to do this now?’”Houlihan has put off renewing her passport, as it’s not due for months. So she simply took it off her to-do list for now. “Because I could just do with one less thing at the moment.”Opting to take time for yourself instead can be an act of self-care, she says. Maher agrees: “If my choice is to go for a run, read a book, see a friend or do life admin, I’m gonna choose the other three things every single day of the week.”",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nMany people struggle with completing life admin tasks, such as combining superannuation accounts or filing tax returns, due to procrastination and lack of confidence. According to experts, this can stem from fear of failure, tediousness, and a lack of proficiency in tasks that require attention to detail.

    "content": "The prosecution: Leanne It looks like a drip and reminds me of a hospital. If he needs a drink, a cup is more appropriate I’ve been with my boyfriend, Wes, for about a year and a half. We don’t live together, and last summer he built himself a four-poster bed, which I thought was really cool. But a few months ago he got one of those water bladders with a long tube and hung it from one side of the bed.He said it was practical, and at first I didn’t mind. I thought it was a joke. There were also moments when I thought it was practical too. Sometimes, when he was drinking from it, I thought: “I’ll have a drink from it as well.” But then I asked him if he was going to take it down, and he just brushed it off.One day, we were having an intimate moment and he whipped out the water bladder and started drinking from it. He should have been concentrating on me so I was annoyed, and now it’s banished.Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. That’s acceptable – but it’s not for the bedroomIt was just a huge turnoff. It looks like a drip and it reminds me of a hospital. When you’re with your partner that’s not the connotation you want. Hydration is important, but if Wes needs a drink during sex a water bottle or a cup of water is more appropriate.The water bladder was up for about two and a half months in total. That moment tipped me over the edge, and thankfully Wes listened to me.We have come to an agreement to keep it out of the bedroom, but I know that part of him wants it back. We are going to a festival this weekend and Wes says he is going to bring two water bladders. I won’t be drinking from one unless there’s an emergency.Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. I think that’s acceptable as it’s what it was originally designed for – but it’s not for the bedroom.Even though we live separately, as I usually go to Wes’s place, I think he should listen to me when I say I’m not comfortable with something. He did take it down after that incident, but I know if I allowed it, the water bladder would go straight back up.The defence: Wes I get that it was maybe insensitive to do it during sex, but I didn’t expect her to be so bothered After building myself a four-poster bed while I was bored, I attached a water bladder I had lying around the house with a little bit of string, looping it over the top of the bed. I thought it was practical and funny. It was really hot recently, so it was a good way to stay hydrated.At first, Leanne drank from it with me when she came round to stay. She didn’t seem opposed to it. But then when I drank from it during an intimate moment she reacted really strongly. Things came to an abrupt halt there and then, and the water bladder was removed immediately. It felt like an overreaction in the face of something I thought was totally innocent. I get that it was bad timing and maybe a bit insensitive to do it during sex. However, I didn’t expect her to be so bothered.We are going to a festival soon and she’s banned me from using it in the tent tooIt started out as “look at this fun idea”, and I thought: “Wow, I can drink hands-free.” But then Leanne said she didn’t like the imagery of it. I do get that the thought of me lying in bed with a tube stuck out of my mouth during sex isn’t very attractive.But we are going to a festival soon and she’s banned it in the tent too. She’s OK with me using it when we’re out and about, just not when I’m lying down inside the tent. I think it’s much more practical than a cup – there’s no risk of spillage. And surely a water bladder is appropriate in any context where you’re camping?If we are in the crowds for hours and Leanne runs out of water, and I’ve got litres left in the bladder, I think she’ll end up using it. It’s a different context to the bedroom, but it seems like the whole idea of the water bladder is totally corrupted for Leanne now.There’s not really a middle ground for her when it comes to the water bladder. I’ve suggested getting a smaller one, but to no avail. Ultimately, Leanne’s upset is more important than the convenience. If it means she is happier, then it’s worth it, but privately I think a water bladder is entirely functional. If she said I could hang it off the bed again, I 100% would.The jury of Guardian readersIs a water bladder acceptable in the bedroom?Water bladders have their place, but should not be used in the home, let alone during an intimate moment. Wes should focus on understanding Leanne’s feelings and how to use bladders appropriately, rather than trying to shoehorn them into every situation.Adnaan, 30Leanne is well within her rights to ban the bladder from the bedroom and also from what functions as a bedroom while they are at the festival. This still leaves Wes plenty of opportunities to hydrate when he’s out and about, just not during sleep or sex!Harmony, 30It’s entirely reasonable to ask that the water bladder isn’t used in the bedroom. Yet, I think it is totally normal to use it in most other contexts, including at a festival. Wes has been willing to make adjustments, so Leanne should let him drink in the tent.Lola, 25Leanne has made it perfectly clear to Wes that she finds the water bladder distasteful, and it makes her uncomfortable. Relationships are about compromise – when your partner tells you they don’t like something, you stop doing it. There is no reasonable excuse to persist with this.Peter, 60Wes isn’t a Formula One driver, he can take 10 seconds to drink from a glass. A bladder at a festival makes sense, but using one in the home is unnecessary. Leanne is right to come down hard on it, and Wes is right to concede.Matt, 30Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us who should suck it upThe poll closes on Wednesday 6 August at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whether Cara should stop scrimping on holiday46% said yes – Cara is guilty54% said no – Cara is innocent",

    "content": "When I first call Rita Labiche-Robinson, a 59-year-old retired project manager, she can’t chat because she is with her nine-year-old granddaughter. Rita looks after Nia two days a week – Thursdays and Fridays. Today is a Tuesday, but they live together, along with Nia’s mum, and Labiche-Robinson is too in the thick of it to talk.The three of them have been in the same home since March last year, when Labiche-Robinson’s daughter and granddaughter moved back from Canada. “While they’re waiting to be housed, they’re staying with me,” she says. On her designated days, she gets Nia up and takes her to school – a 10-minute walk from her home in Hackney, east London. At the end of the day, she picks Nia up, prepares her dinner and reads to her before bed.“It keeps me active,” she says. Nia teaches her grandma about TikTok. Plus, as she sees it, if someone else is being paid to look after Nia, “then I’m missing out on my granddaughter growing up”.Labiche-Robinson is one of millions of grandparents in the UK who, because of extended life expectancy, shifts in the nature of family life and cripplingly expensive childcare, are taking on a level of grandparenting that looks a lot more like parenting.A report from 2017 estimated that 9 million British grandparents – the “grey army” – spent an average of eight hours a week helping to care for their grandchildren. A 2023 survey found that more than half of UK grandparents provide some sort of childcare during the working week, doing more than four hours a day on average.Of course, that still leaves nearly half who don’t; I know many parents whose own parents don’t lift a finger, let alone wipe a bum. And why should they? They have done their parenting years – and the northern lights aren’t going to see themselves.But go to any stay-and-play or music class and there will be at least one grandparent rolling play‑dough or bashing a tambourine. Push a swing and you won’t be more than a metre from one of the older generation pushing another. While I am writing this article, there is a grandparent downstairs in my own home, pretending to be a monster, so I can work. My daughter’s grandparents, on both sides, have provided scheduled and ad hoc care since she was a baby. My partner and I couldn’t have coped – financially or psychologically – without them.Via community groups and charities, word of mouth and a Guardian callout, I have heard from scores of grandparents who look after their offspring’s offspring, doing school runs, sleepovers, film nights and baking. Several have moved house to be nearer their grandchildren, or had their children move closer to them off the back of the promise of childcare. So why do they do it?The main reason for many is simple: they enjoy it. Anita Pollack and Phil Bradbury moved out of Newham, east London, after 50 years to be near their grandchildren in Essex. “Though we had both looked forward to grandchildren, neither of us anticipated the quite overwhelming bond of love grandparents have for the grandchildren,” Pollack says.Others take pleasure in being able to help their adult children. Having never known either of his grandfathers, Alan Foster, 75, from Bognor Regis, West Sussex, spent a month living with his daughter when his grandson was born, “so she could ease back into work gradually and I could get to know my grandson before he started nursery”. He did it again when his second grandchild was born.There is also a recognition of the challenges facing parents today. “We are in awe of the responsibilities our children have to juggle with working, plus the cost of childcare, so we are happy to give any help,” says Martin Roach, who is retired. Along with his wife, he has looked after various grandchildren every Wednesday – from 7am to 7pm – for six years.Some grandparents I speak to say that being around young children at an older stage of life gives them the space they didn’t have with their own children. Maria, a retired childminder in Manchester, says: “We don’t have the added stress or pressures we had when our children were growing up. We have more time to just enjoy being with them.” Wendy, 77, who lives in Guildford and looks after her two grandsons once a week, says: “Grandparenting is better than being a parent. There is less anxiety.”Of course, when grandparents are so deeply invested, it can lead to friction. There may be disagreements about values. After all, even the basics of how children are looked after now differ, sometimes drastically, from the way many in this generation brought up their own children. In a 2021 study of British grandmothers, some participants were taken aback by the expectation that children be constantly supervised.In my home, as well as many others, the consumption of sugar is a common source of tension. “She’s eaten well today,” my mum has reported on occasion, before listing off a cheese toastie, cake and “a bit of Grandad’s Twix bar”. Occasionally, screen time can be a jostle – just how many episodes of Bing is too many? Everyone says it’s gratifying, but then there is a lot of burden and obligation as wellSeveral grandparents report finding the prevailing style of “gentle parenting” tricky. Take this example, from an anonymous Guardian reader: “I have no issue with telling them if they have done something wrong. The four-year-old pushed her friend out of the way. My response was to make her say sorry to her friend straight away; her mum would rather talk to her and ask why she did it.”If grandparents are providing free childcare, is it reasonable to expect them to follow their own children’s ideals when it comes to care? They aren’t, after all, professional childcare workers.Despite this, the benefits outweigh any costs for all parties, says Anna Rotkirch, a Finnish sociologist who studies population ageing and families. “If you have a strong, close relationship to a grandparent compared with those who don’t, then you have fewer problems.” In times of upheaval – when parents divorce, for instance – “if you have at least one strong bond to a grandparent, that will be a kind of resilience booster”. An older relative’s home can be a raft of stability during difficult times with your parents.Denise Burke runs the thinktank United for All Ages with her husband, Stephen Burke. She does this as well as picking up her eight-year-old grandson, Ardy, from school once a week and having him overnight. “It’s not just about the childcare, it’s what Ardy gets out of it,” she says. She cites trips to the local Indian restaurant or the pub. “He gets on well with our friends … and I think it really does children good to be mixing with all ages.”For grandparents, taking care of children brings the possibility of stimulation, cognitive sharpening and structure in a potentially amorphous life after retirement. John Perry and his wife take their 10-year-old granddaughter, Eva, to and from school, a 10-minute drive from where they live in the Nottinghamshire town of Bingham, most days. He says Eva has helped demystify supermarket self-service checkouts. “‘Oh, Grandad, just give it to me,’ she’ll say. She’ll scan it all and then go: ‘Grandad, give me your card.’”John L Bazalgette, who lives in south-west London, is 89 and has 13 grandchildren. He puts the benefits of looking after the children in terms of wisdom “mutually developed between the different generations … Discovering that we may have similar feelings, triggered by trying to belong in a shared fragmented world, can lead to deep experiences of attachment and love.”While there have been suggestions that caring for grandchildren keeps people young, a 2022 study suggested that any “rejuvenating effect” from looking after grandchildren is a myth. The idea of whether care feels like a burden is central. Carole Easton, a psychotherapist and the chief executive of the Centre for Ageing Better, says that, among her grandparent friends, “there is a sense of obligation: ‘I’m not sure how they would manage if we didn’t do this’”. It’s not, she says, a complaint as much as “an acknowledgment that there isn’t a genuine choice in this”.I see this phase of my life as an opportunity to achieve things I put to one side earlierMany grandparents will still be juggling their work lives, too. Olga Grünwald is a researcher based in the Netherlands who looks at the positive and negative experiences of grandparenting. She says that for this new “sandwich generation” of grandparents balancing work and childcare, “everyone says: ‘Oh, it’s gratifying,’ but then there is a lot of burden and obligation as well”. An English teacher, who wishes to remain anonymous, says she suggested having her three grandchildren round every Friday night, as it means getting to have regular time with them. “My job is very demanding and sometimes I am very tired at the end of the working week,” she says. “But my grandchildren are just such a joy that they really lift me up – before I eventually collapse on the couch!”According to a small survey of grandparents by the childcare app Bubble in 2022, one in four reported retiring earlier to provide childcare. “That’s not a choice,” says Easton. “We are losing older people from the workplace, which is causing damage to our economy and to the workplace in terms of experience and knowledge.”Many grandparents I speak to report frustration at slipping boundaries and supposedly part‑time arrangements becoming full-time. I’m sure I have sometimes over‑asked my parents and they have been too kind to say no. One anonymous retired grandmother says of her daughter: “I have enabled her to earn a good wage. I received no payment of any description.”Frances Stadlen, a 76-year-old writer, gardener and baker in west London, had a discussion with her eldest son as soon as he said he was starting a family, explaining what her boundaries would be regarding childcare. Having been a stay-at-home mother when her children were growing up, she says: “I was not willing to enter into any regular childcare commitment.”That is not to say she doesn’t welcome her grandchildren into her home – her house is filled with toys and books – and she gives them her undivided attention when they are there, which, for each set of grandchildren, generally works out at one afternoon a week. However, she says: “I see this phase of my life as a significant opportunity to achieve things I put to one side at an earlier phase. In society as a whole, I observe an undervaluation or active devaluation of the legitimate aspirations of older women to live disentangled from the domestic sphere, should they so wish.”Some grandparents report not having time for their own interests, or feeling selfish when they take time for themselves. Perry and his wife, Veronica, often travel to their static caravan in France. “Rather than going for a long period, because of these commitments, we’ll just go for a week at a time.” Not in the school holidays, though. “We’re just around to help out, you know, as and when we’re needed.”Of course, grandparents wouldn’t need to be so heavily involved if childcare costs weren’t so prohibitively expensive. The cost of childcare in the UK is among the highest in the world. According to the children’s charity Coram, summer holiday clubs this year cost parents an average of £1,075 a child – an average increase of 4% on 2024, with some areas seeing rises as high as 13%.If grandparents are backed into a corner because of the lack of affordable childcare, is something lost? Perhaps. While Paula Carter, a 59-year-old retired nurse, adores her grandchildren, “and all the care means I have a close and loving relationship with them”, she also feels that she misses out on “just being the granny”.In Finland, where childcare is subsidised based on income and family size and capped at about €300 (£260) a month, “there’s this expression that grandchildren are the dessert of life … the benefits without the burden”, says Rotkirch. “Very intensive grandchild care is not always ideal for the grandparents or even a grandchild. When we talk about caring for grandchildren in the Nordics, it’s an evening, or it’s when the child is ill for a few days, but it’s not every day for four hours.”Very intensive grandchild care is not always ideal for the grandparents or even a grandchildHigh-quality, affordable childcare would mean that the older generation could swoop in with their stickers, sweets and stories about life before the internet out of choice rather than obligation. It would allow them to enjoy time with their grandchildren rather than being called upon to plug the gaps of a system not fit for purpose – which, according to most of the grandparents I speak to for this piece, can be very tiring. I know my parents love hanging out with my daughter and get something different and rewarding from taking care of her without her parents around. But they are no doubt glad that we now have more of an ad hoc arrangement than the previous one, which involved regular, full days: scrambling eggs at 8am and keeping a toddler amused until past 6pm.Easton, who regularly cares for her grandson and loves to do so, says she often jokes with her other grandparent friends that “a woman shouldn’t be allowed to have a baby until she’s checked with the grandparents first”. The serious point here is that grandparents are now so often part of the caring package for young children that perhaps this should be a consideration.When Labiche-Robinson’s daughter and granddaughter eventually move out, she will still be getting involved, she says: she is invested in raising Nia. “She’s my granddaughter. So I’m very attached her – to all of them, my children and my grandchildren … while I’m here, I might as well help the family.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "content": "One morning in 2018, my husband Reuben told me about a nightmare he’d had the previous night. He’d been driving over the Hewitt Avenue Trestle, a bridge near our house in Everett, Washington in the US, crashed through the barriers into the estuary below, and had to decide which of our two children to save.Two weeks later, I was getting Talia, then three, and Weston, 10 months, dressed, fed and out of the door to take them to preschool on my way to work.It was a route we’d taken a hundred times before. I was chatting to Reuben on speakerphone with both children in the back, when I smelled something odd, like plastic melting.I mentioned it to Reuben, but neither of us thought anything of it. There are industrial buildings nearby, so I assumed it was coming from one of them.A minute later, and no longer on the phone, I drove on to the bridge my husband had dreamed about, which was busy with rush-hour traffic. That’s when I saw the word “STOP” flash across my dashboard.Before I even had the chance to register it, I saw smoke rising from the bonnet of the car. I knew I needed to pull over, but the bridge, which is 2.5 miles long, didn’t have a hard shoulder. I decided it was safest to get across it and then stop the car.The smoke coming out of the bonnet was so thick I couldn’t see the road ahead. I pulled over and acted on pure instinctGripping the steering wheel, I put my foot down, but within seconds the smoke was so thick I could no longer see the road ahead. With cars flying past me, I managed to pull over to the side of the road.At this point, I was really distressed. I called the American Automobile Association (AAA), but, as if my luck wasn’t bad enough, my membership had expired. As I was talking to the operator, I saw flames through the windshield – the bonnet was on fire.Terrified, and certain the car was about to explode, I yelled that my car was on fire. Acting on pure instinct, I jumped out, opened the door behind me, and unclipped Weston’s car seat.I could hear the woman from the AAA shouting at me to call 911 as cars and lorries thundered past, just inches away. For a split second I froze. Was it safe to put Weston down on the road while I grabbed Talia? Could I run to the end of the bridge with them both in my arms?Just then, as I was almost overwhelmed with fear, an arm appeared. I looked up into the face of a man who said, “It’s OK, mama”, took Weston from my hands and went to his car, which was just behind me.I dashed round to Talia’s door, opening it to see flames inside, and spreading fast. She looked at me in terror and screamed, “Mummy!” Within a second, I had her in my arms, running back to the man’s car. As we zoomed off, I looked over my shoulder and saw flames shooting into the sky. Talia was sobbing into my chest.Unable to think clearly, I didn’t call 911 or Reuben, I just asked for us to be dropped at a nearby car dealership. I thanked my heroic rescuer and hugged him goodbye, only later realising that I didn’t even get his name.Reuben’s work was about 50 miles away, so I called a friend nearby, who immediately came to get us. He’s a funny guy, and, as I fell into his arms, weeping, he quipped: “Sorry I’m late. There was some big fire on the road.”I called Reuben on the way to my parents’ house. He was devastated, repeatedly apologising for not knowing the smell was something serious. I tried to reassure him: I hadn’t known, either.Seeing the burnt-out car arrive later that day before it was scrapped was awful. I felt sick at the thought of what might have happened if I hadn’t got the children out when I did.While Weston appeared unaffected throughout, and Talia was back to her happy self within hours, I struggled. I had awful dreams where I endlessly relived it. When driving our new car, I’d obsessively open the windows at the slightest smell, convinced it was on fire.A session of EMDR [eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing] therapy helped a lot. I was even able to drive across the Trestle and stay calm.We never found out what caused the fire. Thankfully, the children have no memory of that day now. And when they moan that Mummy doesn’t do this or that, I remind them that I entered a burning car for them – and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.

    "content": "I was very clear about wanting a family early in our relationship, but after two and a half years together my partner has admitted he doesn’t want kids. This is the best relationship I’ve had – he’s kind, patient, supportive, and we have the best sex. We’re both anxious people with avoidance issues, but I felt safe and cherished until last year, when I discovered he had cheated. He said it was an attempt to “escape”. I was deeply shocked. I ended the relationship, but he begged for another chance and accepted an ultimatum: commit to living together, getting a dog and starting a family (things I told him I wanted early on). He agreed to the first two, but said he needed more time for the last.I am 38 and asked repeatedly for honesty about children, fearing the same heartbreak I felt with my ex‑husband. Yet he kept it ambiguous, only to finally admit that he doesn’t want children but is afraid to lose me. I respect that it’s his decision, but I’m hurt and angry about being misled.I am a touring artist, which makes starting a family challenging, and it feels impossible to do it alone. I fear that if I can’t make music – vital for my emotional and financial wellbeing – I may succumb to the depression and repeat the grim fate of my parents.After years of dating, I can’t seem to find anyone I have much in common with who wants a family. The thought of ending up alone and childless terrifies me. I am trying to think of an alternative solution but, if I’m being honest, anything other than having a family with the person you love and who loves you back feels like a compromise.I’m so sorry you’ve been lied to. I feel that your inner voice has been screaming at you, but somewhere along the line you’ve learned to reason away your feelings. This man doesn’t sound like he’s the one for you. He has lied and he has cheated and you deserve better than to be scrambling around the “good bits” to somehow convince yourself that you need to make this work. You don’t.When you are in a situation that feels stuck, it’s impossible to imagine solutions, or a life better lived. I consulted relationship therapist Joanna Harrison, who said: “I can see that wherever you look it feels like there’s mourning to do [for your parents’ depression, your ex-marriage, your current situation]. You sound like someone who battles on alone, and perhaps this was essential with parents who were depressed.”One study showed that when couples had a baby despite a strong difference of views, they all separated by the time their first child went to schoolI wonder whether you could seek some therapy to tease out the threads of your past life with someone who is “on your side”, and to explore the loops that keep repeating. Both Harrison and I also wondered if your current relationship only seemed “kind and supportive” compared with past ones. If so, there are other kinder, more supportive relationships you may yet strive for.Harrison added: “One longitudinal study of parents showed that in a sample of couples who had a baby when there had been a strong difference of views about having a baby, in all cases the couples had separated by the time their first child went to primary school. It’s very painful for couples to be faced with a situation where there is no compromise, and it is very upsetting to lose the relationship and have to make this decision.”But I’d add that it would be easier in the long run than an unsatisfactory compromise. Also, why should you alone compromise? That would eat away at you in a different way. As your inner voice is saying: you need to try.You may well meet the right person for you. In the meantime, you said in your longer letter that you were open to alternatives, such as co-parenting, or a less nuclear-family option. “It feels that it would be unkind to yourself to not at least explore these options,” says Harrison. “It may not be what you choose, but it may be helpful to explore what these different ways of doing things would mean to you.”You may also find this Guardian article of interest, as well as my podcasts on Should I Have a Baby? and Hope and Loss.

    "content": "My partner and I are both creatives. Six years ago we were living in a tiny apartment in Sydney’s inner west, and I was paying extra for a studio. It wasn’t sustainable so we decided to move to Katoomba, on the traditional lands of the Dharug and Gundungurra people.I read an article recently saying something like “skip it, it’s not at its best” but Katoomba has a beautiful authenticity, even if it’s not quite polished.Our closest upper mountain towns are Leura and Blackheath. Katoomba is all old-world treasures and beautiful building facades. Blackheath has the incredible Victory Theatre Antique Centre, Gleebooks, Hat Hill Records & Audio and great rock climbing and hikes. Leura has an upscale main drag full of lifestyle and fashion stores, but it gets busy on weekends. I recommend walking the backstreets to see the cute cottages and gardens.FoodOur favourite place to eat is the award-winning Ates in Blackheath. It serves delicious Mediterranean-style share plates and always feels like a special night out. Much of its food is cooked in its 150-year-old wood-fired oven and there’s a greenery-filled courtyard.On weekends, Tempus Katoomba has a fine-dining menu with an incredible all-Australian drinks list. It’s in the old bank and lots of historical parts remain but the interiors are fun and fresh. On weekday mornings it switches to the Tempest Up Early cafe, serving Little Marionette coffee.We’re so lucky to have Black Cockatoo bakery here. It’s run by a French expat Alexandre Rivière and uses organic Australian flour and Pepe Saya cultured butter. Savoury or sweet, it’s all delicious. It’s a cool space, too, with custom ply joinery and lots of plants.We just discovered The Laughing Elephant in Wentworth Falls. It’s an Asian grocer but they make amazing banh mi and laksa at lunchtimes.Fidelity is a new cafe run by two super-warm and welcoming guys with a deep passion for coffee. The seating spills outside with lots of dogs and friendly vibes. I drink decaf and often feel self-conscious but the baristas at Fidelity are like, “You’ve got to try this decaf!” The house-made chai is great too. Cassiopeia has great coffee and baked goods too; it roasts its beans in Leura.NatureLyrebird Dell walking track in Leura is magical. It’s shaded and cool with waterfalls and tree ferns so it’s great in summer. You can detour down to the Pool of Siloam waterhole for a swim. It has a sandy beach and doesn’t get too crowded.Lockley Pylon is a three-hour walk (7.2km return) mostly along a ridge in north Leura. It’s known for stunning wildflowers in spring, like boronia and waratah. It’s very exposed, so walking on windy or super-hot days is not advised. At the end there’s an incredible view over the Grose Valley.Wentworth Falls Lake Park has a new walkway and a viewing platform along the eastern edge that’s pram and wheelchair-friendly. The area still feels wild in places but there’s also a big playground, a cute jetty and ducks. People kayak and canoe here; we like to swim on the north side in the shade of the gumtrees. It’s busy on weekends with people barbecuing and picnicking.Minnehaha Falls in North Katoomba is 2.7km return with some stairs, but the waterhole at the end is a sublime swimming spot. The track follows Yosemite Creek which has loads of scribbly gums and banksia.I love native plants but I’m also a sucker for the lilacs, tulips and maples at Everglades House and Gardens. The art deco house is a wonderful glimpse into the past and you can do Devonshire tea in the tearoom. The 12-acre garden is manicured in some parts and bushy in others and you can picnic on the lawn.NightlifeDown in the Lawson industrial area (15 minutes’ drive east of Katoomba) is a quarterly experimental arts event run by SIRC_UIT. It’s always a unique experience, with performance and installation, and there’s a pop-up bar and food.Zoe’s Blackheath has live music, Italian-influenced pub-style food and a great bar for a casual drink.Mountain Culture Brewpub in Katoomba is in a rambling 1900s building. The co-owner is originally from North Carolina; it has won many awards for its beers. There’s great views and yummy burgers and fried pickles.Aqua Ignis is a new sauna and bathhouse in Blackheath that’s open until 9pm. It has magnesium baths and a herbal steam room; it’s such a restorative evening. Blue Mountains Sauna in Leura has been around longer; it’s a more traditional Nordic-style space with regular clothing optional sessions.InspirationBlue Mountains Cultural Centre in Katoomba is a crucial stop for art lovers. It features touring shows, such as the Archibald prize and the Wynne prize, as well as exhibitions from renowned local artists such as Claire Healy, Sean Cordeiro and Nick Stathopoulos. There’s also an immersive permanent video installation filmed in the national park.I’m a mural artist, and the encouragement of street art here is so nice. Me and four other female mural artists painted the Froma Lane walkway that connects Katoomba Street to the centre.Beverley Place was really dilapidated 10 years ago before it was transformed into the Katoomba Street Art Walk. When a wall mural fades a new artist is invited to paint it. It’s a really cool space to walk through. The cultural centre runs short street art tours or you can use a self-guided map.Landslide Gallery in Wentworth Falls was once an old flour mill. It runs an Australia-wide and international artist-in-residency program and its exhibitions showcase the incredibly diverse mediums of Blue Mountains artists, from ceramics to sculpture, paintings and textile art.Day Gallery is a commercial gallery in Blackheath; the couple behind it, Helen and Vincent Day, are legends. Their roster of artists is truly inspiring. During Covid lockdowns, renowned local painter and musician Claire Nakazawa (from the band Haiku Hands) created a mural on the external wall as her response to the landscapes after the black summer fires.NeighbourhoodThe area around the Blue Mountains Cultural Centre in Katoomba is getting so vibrant. Katoomba Civic Centre’s gardens are re-landscaped with tree ferns and banksias, and it’s a lovely stroll through the Carrington hotel’s garden down to Katoomba Street.The Blue Mountains Co-op is near there and has a kiosk with the most amazing soups. The co-op market garden is next to the cultural centre and the Carrington hotel. It’s run by Farm it Forward, which makes unused pieces of land productive. This patch was long abandoned and now it has a head farmer and the co-op sells its seasonal organic produce. I painted a produce-inspired mural on an adjoining heritage-listed wall to bring some joy and to revive the space.AccommodationThe Carrington (from $230 a night) is an old-world beauty and I love looking at the historical photographs of how Katoomba began, with just the Carrington at the top of the hill and this rickety train line.The Kyah (from $190 per night) is a very cool renovated motel in Blackheath. It has a great restaurant called Blaq, gardens, a tennis court and a hot tub.Chalets at Blackheath (from $1,300 a night; sleeps two) are very high-end and dreamy. There are four freestanding chalets with bushland views. They have fireplaces, bathtubs and a sundeck; you’re really immersed in the environment and birdsong.Cloud Parade (from $1,095 a night; sleeps 10) is an Airbnb in Leura with lovely interiors and stunning valley views. It’s only a 15-minute walk to the town centre, which is impressive, because often places with views this good are a fair hike from the shops.

    "content": "Caitlin. A literal ‘boys’ club’ I haven’t heard of has banned a type of sock. What’s going on?Hold my prosecco and plate of canapes, do I have a story for you. According to the Australian Financial Review, the elite private members Australian Club in Sydney has embarked on a war on men’s socks, and the common sockette is in the firing line.As per the AFR, the club secretary has distributed amendments to its dress requirements for the clubhouse, which requires that jackets be “tailored” and that socks – which, they note, “must be worn by gentlemen”, should cover above the ankle.I can only assume the fashion police will be waiting at the doors, and if you have a low-rise ankle sock on, or, even worse, no sock at all, you’re in danger.I thought private members’ clubs were from the 18th century. We still have them?Unfortunately, yes.The Australian Club is actually the oldest gentlemen’s club in the southern hemisphere, established in 1838 as a private, men’s only establishment. It’s part of a string of reciprocal elite clubs around the globe, including the Melbourne Club and Athenaeum Club, also in Melbourne.According to its website, the Sydney club, situated at 165 Macquarie Street, boasts “unparalleled views” of the Botanic Gardens and north shore, “where tradition and modernity are skilfully blended”. Sockettes, presumably, do not count in that skilful blend.Wow that’s so retro. How is it still men’s only?Ima, be reasonable. When it opened, this was a different era. It was 1838! Women couldn’t vote, hold political office, or own property in their own right. But yeah, it’s still a boys’ club.In 2021, 62% of its members, who include John Howard and Malcom Turnbull, controversially rejected a proposal to allow women to join (though we don’t know how the former prime ministers voted), with some fearing the “atmosphere” of the club could be “irreparably damaged”.Women are welcome to stay in the clubhouse and use facilities when a member is with them though! They just can’t go on the first floor until after 5pm.Right, that makes sense. A “no girls allowed” vibe. So what were the rules for entry before?A pretty stringent dress code has always been in place. Members and their “gentlemen guests” have to wear a jacket and tie (though on the “relaxed” third floor, ties are optional), and “ladies” can wear a dress, skirt, tailored trousers with a jacket or evening pants.No denim is allowed, and don’t even think about sports shoes. This is the Australian Club – not the wild west.So. Many. Questions. If pants are a prerequisite, why ban sockettes? Not cute, but don’t they remain out of sight? Or are more members rocking a three-quarter chino these days? If an exposed ankle is the cause of scandal … is it the sensuality of a man’s lower leg?I don’t want to think about the sensuality of an old man’s leg.But honestly, if it were me making the rules, I would ban sockettes on the basis they’re just a bit daggy. I mean, their slightly longer cousin, ankle socks, have been colloquially referred to as “millennial socks” because they’re such a fashion faux pas among youth.And the Australian Club is all about “modernity”. Its members may have a median age above 60, but that doesn’t mean they’re not sailing on the winds of contemporary fashion. I’m with the secretary. Get with the times, I say, and pull up your socks.",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe Australian Club, a men's-only private club in Sydney established in 1838, has updated its dress code to ban socks that do not cover above the ankle. The club, which is part of a network of elite global clubs, now requires \"gentlemen\" to wear tailored jackets and socks that meet the new standard. This move has been seen as a strict enforcement of traditional dress codes in a club that has only recently begun to evolve with the times.",

    "content": "What began with a large bamboo ring wrapped in brown paper and posted across the Pacific to an Australian war bride in the US launched what became one of the world’s greatest fads of the late 1950s – the hula hoop.But Joan Anderson, the parcel’s recipient and the woman who delivered the concept of the hoop to America, was left out of the loop – ignored by the toy company that sold more than 100m hula hoops before the fad was replaced.It was not until 2018 that Anderson, who died on 14 July aged 101, was credited for her role in introducing the hula hoop after her story was shared in the short documentary film Hula Girl.The film provided Anderson the opportunity to tell her side of a story that involved the thrill of innovation quickly followed by the ache of betrayal and the worth of a “gentleman’s handshake”.In 1956, while on a return visit to her home town of Sydney, Anderson noticed how many people were having fun with large bamboo hoops, wriggling them around their waists and shimmying their hips like Elvis Presley.“Everywhere I would go, everybody was giggling and carrying on and when I asked what was going on they said, ‘Oh, everyone’s doing the hoop’,” she said.The joy was contagious and upon her return to the US where she was living, she told her husband, Wayne, about it. He wanted to see one of these hoops, so Anderson’s mother posted one over and during a dinner party demonstration of the hoop, after a guest compared Anderson’s moves to those of a hula dancer, the name hula hoop was born.“There are so many stories about where the name came from, and they are all fictitious” Anderson said in the film. “This is the true story about it.”Realising its potential as a toy product, the Andersons contacted an associate of Wayne’s named Arthur “Spud” Melin, the founder of the Wham-O toy company, whose instincts they trusted. They met in the company’s parking lot.“There were no witnesses; just Spud, my husband and myself,” Anderson recalled. “We told him we’ve called it the hula hoop, and he thought that was a great name for it.”Melin was intrigued and, as he and Wayne shook hands, he assured the Andersons that if the hula hoop made money for him, it would make money for them too.By 1958, as the popularity of the hoops – now patented, plastic and produced by Wham-O – escalated and, with sales exceeding US$30m in two months, the Andersons’ phone calls remained unanswered, messages not returned.The only credit given to Joan Anderson was as the “friend from Australia” who had inspired Melin.“I think that bugged me more than anything,” Anderson said. “I was not a ‘friend’.”Joan Constance Manning was born in Sydney on 28 December 1923 to Claude and Ethel Manning. After leaving school at 14, she began modelling, with ambitions to become a film star. She was a diminutive figure, just over five feet tall, and was nicknamed the Pocket Venus.In December 1941, Joan was the cover girl of Pix magazine and was declared to be “a typical Australian holiday girl” whose war work included knitting socks and writing letters. She received a picture of herself from troops at Tobruk who wrote, “you make us forget Libya”.While swimming at Bondi beach in 1945, Joan was approached by US Army Air corps P-38 pilot Wayne Anderson, who did not make an impression until she saw him that night at a dance in his uniform. Four months later, they were married and, in early 1946, she joined hundreds of other war brides on their journey to America.In 1961, the Andersons filed a lawsuit against the Wham-O toy company and eventually settled with a small amount of compensation.“Why be angry with something you can’t change? The world isn’t fair but life goes on. I had a great life,” Joan Anderson said. “My husband lived to be 87 and we had 63 wonderful years together. Happiness is the best revenge.”She and Wayne had four children: Warren, Gary, Carl and Loralyn, three of whom survive her. Wayne died in 2007. Despite the hula hoop disappointment, the Anderson children all had hoops as they grew up.“It was never a big deal in our family. [My parents] went on with their lives. They knew they messed up with the business deal,” Loralyn Willis said.Somalian Australian circus artist Marawa, an inductee of the Guinness World Record Hall of Fame for her hooping prowess, met Anderson in 2018 and was struck by her grace over her lost business opportunity.“If I can be like Joan when I am 100 then I’ll be happy,” she said. “Meeting her made me realise I’ve made the right career choice for a long life.”Willis said her mother was “fun-loving, adventurous and willing to try anything”. She was ziplining, parasailing and boogie boarding with her grandchildren until her mid-90s.“Mom was pretty happy that she got the recognition in the end and that she was able to bring so much joy to people around the world,” she said. “How can you hula hoop without being happy?”",

    "content": "It was 1996 and I was in a nightclub in Tokyo. I was 26 and had been living and working in Japan for three years. I was dancing, along with my friends, to the thump of hypnotic house music. Next to me, an older Japanese man wearing glasses moved closer. Dressed in a dark blue suit, the attire of a “salaryman”, he looked out of place. He puffed on a cigarette as he tapped me on the shoulder. “You look like you can sing,” he shouted over the music. Why would he think that, I wondered. Because I am Black, something of a rarity in Japan? Did he also presume I had natural rhythm and could run a speedy 100-metre dash? I told him I taught English in a language school, but he pressed a crisp meishi (business card) into my hand and said: “I’m a talent scout for a music label and you look like you can sing. Call me.”I wasn’t sure that I could sing. Like most people, I was partial to belting out a show tune in the shower and, given that I lived in Japan, I sang at karaoke. I could hold a tune, but I was no Whitney. Still, I was curious, so I decided to call.A few months later, I was in a recording studio in Tokyo, clutching a microphone. Although I wrote the lyrics to the music, which was composed by a Canadian producer, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was out of my depth. My trip-hop debut landed in Tower Records’ flagship store in Shibuya in the summer of 1997. Despite the glamour of being able to secure a table in the city’s hottest restaurants, performing the odd gig and signing autographs (I recorded my CD under my Yoruba Nigerian middle name, Adebisi, rather than my first name), the adrenaline rush soon wore off and doubt crept in.My album wasn’t exactly lighting up the charts and the royalties were not flowing. I started to feel like an impostor. I met other singers in Tokyo who had slogged for years on the circuit hoping to catch a break. How could I call myself a singer? I had got there by luck: I was in the right place at the right time, but I wasn’t exceptionally talented.Little wonder my “singing career” was over before it started. In 1998, I returned to my day job teaching English and my producer found another singer, a woman with a voice like an angel.After five years of living in Tokyo, I felt it was time to return to the UK. I left for London in the winter of 1999, a couple of months before I hit 30. By 2011, I was living in rural Norfolk and, apart from my family and a few friends, no one knew about my moment in the spotlight. I held on to a cardboard box of Japanese memorabilia – the sole reminder of my previous life – but I was never tempted to listen to the album I had made; I felt embarrassed by it.Then, in the spring of 2022, I started writing my memoir, reflecting on aspects of my life that I had forgotten – or buried. For the first time in more than 25 years, I listened to my album, not once, but several times. I spent a rainy afternoon marvelling at the expressive freedom in my voice and began to wonder if I could find joy in singing again.I joined the Big Heart and Soul choir in Norfolk on a cold, drizzly night in January 2025. I slipped quietly into the hall, keeping on my hat and coat, and sat with a gaggle of women clutching song sheets. “Welcome to the sopranos,” one of them said, with a wry smile. “Join in when you feel ready,” said the person next to me.The emotion, depth and beauty of their singing brought tears to my eyes. Slowly, I began to join inI didn’t open my mouth. If I wanted to sing again, was it really as part of a rural community choir? I gripped my lyric sheet, biting my lip. Then, as I listened, the choir’s harmonies soared and the hairs on my forearms stood up. The emotion, depth and beauty of their singing brought tears to my eyes. Slowly, I began to join in, my voice tentative at first, then louder. I was no longer a lone voice singing into a microphone in a stuffy recording studio in Tokyo; I was part of a larger, collaborative sound. In that moment, decades of feeling like a fraud lifted. The harmonies we created were so jubilant and full of life that I sang with a permanent grin.When the class ended, one of the choir members asked if I had sung before. I paused before telling her the truth – about the stranger in the nightclub, the album in Tokyo and how I had lost confidence in my voice. “So, you were big in Japan,” she deadpanned. I smiled.After that, there was no stopping me. My singing voice was no longer hidden in a box of memorabilia; I sang whenever possible, belting out cheesy show tunes in the shower and singing along to my own record in the car. Now, if I hear a song I like, it doesn’t matter if I only vaguely know the words; I sing along anyway. Joining my local choir made me feel unbound, like a baby learning to walk, stumbling into a playground of endless vocal adventures. I may not be Whitney, but, really, who is?

    "content": "Before I became a paramedic, I didn’t expect the job would change how I load a dishwasher. Or eat a sandwich. Or look at trampolines. I knew it would change how I see others – watching people die tends to do that. But nearly 10 years in, I’ve realised how much it’s quietly altered my day-to-day life.Being a paramedic makes you see danger everywhere, so you avoid risks because you’re always expecting you’ll need to spring into action, even when you’re not in uniform. Once you’ve seen as many stretchers loaded with avoidable disasters as I have, you end up wired differently, and always brace for the next catastrophe.I can’t walk into cafes, living rooms or kids’ birthday parties without conducting a risk assessment. I look for the nearest exits and sharp corners and often wonder if that defibrillator sitting on the wall covered in dust still works.At a party I once caught a toddler chewing on a deflated helium balloon. His parents were deep into their fourth round of Aperol spritzes, so I had to gently explain to them that a balloon can block an airway faster than you can sing Happy Birthday.It’s from experience more than from anxiety. A loose paver. Stray grapes. A poorly timed bomb into a pool. You stop seeing everyday life as nonthreatening once you’ve spent 45 minutes tearing apart someone’s lounge room on your hands and knees looking for a button battery in the hope it’s not halfway down a digestive tract.I will never again get on a motorbike, or on a trampoline. No judgment to the people who ride them. Or bounce on them. But I’ve been to too many scenes where someone came off second-best to physics. Motorbikes and trampolines both offer the illusion of freedom – right until the moment your femur is split into six parts.  for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning One of my first traumatic jobs involved a man who was clipped at an intersection. His helmet survived but his spinal cord didn’t. I’ve seen legs detached, ribcages shattered and vital organs thrown three metres from where they belonged.Trampolines have morbid minds of their own. I once treated a child who launched clean off the mat and on to a garden stake. Now, every time I see someone weaving through traffic in shorts and thongs – or letting their kid somersault unsupervised on a back yard trampoline – I think: “That’s too much paperwork for my day off.” I guess you could call it pattern recognition.I don’t touch recreational drugs – not that I would have anyway – because I’ve seen what happens when people assume their party cocaine isn’t laced with fentanyl. The Pulp Fiction-style overdoses aren’t fiction any more. And after watching the ketamine I’ve administered turn people into catatonic zombies, I’ve got no desire to try it myself (unless I take up trampolining and end up with a fractured femur).But just as I’ve learned to fear what others overlook, I’ve also stopped worrying about some of the things that send everyone else into a panic. I’ve lost count of the number of people who’ve called an ambulance because their smartwatch told them their heart rate was “elevated” or “irregular”. Some were convinced they were having a heart attack because the little waveform on the screen looks vaguely medical, as if a cheap wrist sensor compares to our $50,000 ECG machines. It’s usually anxiety. Or coffee.We also get alerts triggered by watches mistaking burpees for car accidents, or older people dropping their watches on the tiles and the sensor thinking they’ve fallen. It’s becoming the new version of rolling on to your VitalCall pendant in your sleep. I’m not anti-technology. I think these devices have their uses. But increasingly, people are outsourcing common sense to apps. Algorithms don’t do context.Maybe strapping on and plugging into these devices is our attempt to control life’s inevitable chaos, as if a notification might keep death at bay. But I’ve seen too much in my time to believe that kind of insurance is possible.Death doesn’t scare me any more. I’ve just learned to see it coming because I’ve seen it turn up in all the places you don’t expect. Like during a jog. Or in a McDonald’s toilet. Even halfway through mowing the lawn. I just assume the universe is indifferent.If anything, this has made me calm. Because I’m useful in a crisis, I’m more patient with people who panic over minor things. If someone cuts their hand on a poorly stacked knife in the dishwasher, I don’t stress. I grab a tea towel and tell them if they apply some pressure, they’ll live.

    "content": "If the British & Irish Lions complete a clean sweep against the Wallabies on Saturday in Sydney, there will be more talk of Australia no longer being a sufficiently challenging destination for a Lions tour. It’s a mirror image of what has happened to the rugby league Lions over the past 15 years, with Australia deciding that neither Great Britain nor England brought the jeopardy, ticket sales or eyeballs required to justify an incoming tour. Instead, the Kangaroos will visit London, Liverpool and Leeds later this year to play England.It has been 33 years since Great Britain toured Australia. Martin Offiah lit up that series in 1992, scoring seven tries in six Tests against Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand. Offiah, who won 33 caps for Great Britain, as well as five for England, cannot believe the Rugby Football League and Australian Rugby League have allowed these showcase events to fade from view. “As a nation we’ve got to have regular fixtures against Australia,” says Offiah. “Not playing them since the World Cup final in 2017 is crazy. When you’re trying to get across that bridge and match them, that’s a massive gap. And we should have been Great Britain for this series – then gone back to England for the World Cup.”Andy Farrell’s team are in action in Sydney, a rugby league citadel, on Saturday; it has been 19 years since the league Lions played there – a shock win in 2006. Most Super League stars this century have never worn the Lions shirt against Australia. Sam Burgess didn’t. Sam Tomkins didn’t represent Great Britain at all. And current superstars Jack Welsby and Herbie Farnworth have not even seen the league Lions play. Let’s explain a sorry tale.When did the Lions start playing?Despite containing dozens of Welshmen, several Scots and an occasional Irishman, for decades the RFL’s national team was known as England. The catalyst for change was the iconic 1946 Indomitables tour, when an “England” squad containing 11 Welshmen docked at Tilbury having won 21 of their 27 games on their tour to Australia and New Zealand. By the time the 1950 tour came round, they were called Great Britain and nicknamed the Lions.When did league let the Lions escape?Young fans could be mistaken for assuming that the union Lions have always toured New Zealand, Australia and South Africa on rotation. Not so. While the league side were visiting the southern hemisphere every four years, union tours were more sporadic, at times up to nine years apart. That has changed in the professional era. Since 1997, the league Lions have toured just three times, the union side eight. Rugby league had the Lions brand and calendar in its hands, but let it slip.In 2007, the RFL declared the series against New Zealand would be the last in Great Britain. The intention was to put more emphasis on the four Home Nations and for the Lions to tour every four years. But 12 years passed before their next tour – and most wish it hadn’t happened at all. The 2019 tour was a historic low, with four straight Test defeats in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.How did they allow this to happen?Initially results did not matter – until they did. Great Britain won just two of their 24 Tests against Australia between a 21-12 victory at an almost empty Wembley in 1973 and a dead-rubber win in Sydney in 1988, including 15 straight defeats. But the Kangaroos kept coming. As long as it made sense on and off the field, the teams met every two years, switching between the northern and southern hemispheres.As the current union tour illustrates, if the commercial opportunities add up, the teams will play. The match on Saturday will be the ninth time Andy Farrell’s side have taken to the field in Australia in five weeks.The league Lions were competitive without being successful and, ultimately, Australia realised they had stronger competition and bigger interest closer to home. Australia were meant to host three Tests in the 2019 tour but they pulled out, leaving the Lions to visit New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. They lost to all three, which was reason enough for some to abandon the Lions for good.Why has the RFL not brought back the Lions?Having canvassed supporters for their opinions, the RFL decided 2025 was not the time to bring back the Great Britain team, given that England are preparing for a World Cup next year and the Celtic nations would contribute little.Had the Lions toured in 2023, continuing the four-year cycle, Scotland lock James Bell might have been picked, alongside a handful of Ireland internationals. But if Shaun Wane were selecting a Great Britain team this October, it would look near-identical to England anyway.Players such as James McDonnell and Morgan Knowles – formerly of Ireland and Wales, respectively – have declared for England in any case. The only player not eligible for England who might make a Lions team is Jaimin Jolliffe, the Gold Coast Titans and Ireland prop. That alone is not a convincing case for the return of the league Lions.Is there a future for the league Lions?The Lions are dormant, but not necessarily extinct. England host Australia later this year, with a return trip pencilled in for 2028. Nigel Wood, back in charge at the RFL, is keen on the Lions reuniting, possibly for that tour, although another option is available.The union Lions launch their tours with money-spinning home games – they played Argentina in Dublin last month, bringing in some much-needed money for both teams. Gate receipts alone yielded in the region of €3m, with the Pumas paid a €1m appearance fee. The league Lions played home fixtures every year for decades and at least one senior RFL employee likes the idea of the four Home Nations uniting to host series against the Kangaroos and Kiwis. No other major team sport does that. It would be unique.The Celtic nations may not be stocked with talent but they have contributed a lot to the team over the years. Only two players have won Lions series in the southern hemisphere in both codes and neither of them is English: Lewis Jones from Wales and Alan Tait from Scotland. And​, enticed with the prospect of facing Australia, it is not hard to imagine Scottish, Welsh and Irish rugby fans getting behind the team. Reviving the Lions would restore one of international rugby league’s unique selling points. Goodness knows, the sport needs it.Follow No Helmets Required on Facebook",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe British and Irish Lions' rugby union team may complete a clean sweep against Australia on Saturday, sparking debate about whether Australia is still a challenging enough destination for a Lions tour. A similar situation has occurred in rugby league, where Australia no longer tours the UK, instead hosting the England team. This has resulted in a significant gap in competitive matches between the two nations, with former player Martin Offiah expressing disappointment at the lack of regular fixtures.",

    "content": "Mollie O’Callaghan has equalled the Australian record for world championship golds after anchoring the women to victory in the 4x200m freestyle relay in Singapore.By securing her 11th career world title on Thursday night, the 21-year-old equalled Ian Thorpe’s Australian record.O’Callaghan is favourite to win her 12th gold in the 100m freestyle on Friday night after reaching the final as fastest qualifier. “It was pretty rough backing it up … [but] it’s a dream to be part of this team,” she said.The victory of O’Callaghan, Lani Pallister, Jamie Perkins and Brittany Castelluzzo was Australia’s third relay gold of the meet and came as the Dolphins also bagged two bronze medals on Thursday night.Kyle Chalmers (men’s 100m freestyle) and Lizzie Dekkers (women’s 200m butterfly) both reached the podium and it means Australia retain top spot on the medal tally with five golds, one silver and five bronze. The United States are second on four golds.Chalmers made it a 14th career medal at world titles but didn’t find the gold he was hoping for as he finished behind Romania’s David Popovici (46.51 seconds) and American Jack Alexy (46.92).However, he remains confident that he can break the sub-47 second mark in the 100m freestyle.Chalmers clocked 47.17 and is yet to swim the race in less than 47 seconds, which is now the realm of world winners.“I have been training hard for that moment, I desperately wanted to get a 46 out tonight, but it wasn’t quite there,” he told Channel Nine. “But to get on the podium is so special.”Chalmers has twice logged personal best times of 47.08 and at the age of 27 believes he can still improve – but he now has other priorities.Chalmers and his partner, Norwegian swimmer Ingeborg Loyning, are expecting their first child next month.“I’m just really excited to go home now and become a dad, that is my biggest priority this year – that [swim] was just a bit of fun,” he said.Chalmers also won gold in Singapore when anchoring Australia’s 4x100m freestyle relay team on Sunday’s opening night.Earlier on Thursday night, Chalmers’ teammate Dekkers took the bronze in a women’s 200m butterfly won by Canadian star Summer McIntosh – the 18-year-old’s third gold of the titles.“Physically, I’m not at my best,” Dekkers said. “So I knew that mentally, I had to be there … I love racing, and that’s why we all do this, because there’s something about standing behind the blocks that we all love.”O’Callaghan cruised through her women’s 100m freestyle semi-final and into Friday night’s medal race as fastest qualifier.O’Callaghan, already with golds in the 200m freestyle and women’s 4x100m relay in Singapore, won her semi in 52.82 seconds but fellow Australian Olivia Wunsch withdrew due to illness.O’Callaghan later Thursday night will race in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay and, if victorious, will equal Ian Thorpe’s Australian record for most golds at world titles, 11.",

    "content": "The Wallabies will take inspiration from retiring scrum-half Nic White as they seek to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test against the British & Irish Lions in Sydney on Saturday.The veteran announced on Thursday he would retire from international rugby after Saturday’s Test and coach Joe Schmidt has handed him the No 9 jersey for his 73rd Wallabies cap in a nod to his long contribution to Australian rugby.White said it was the right time to “pass on the baton” to players like Jake Gordon and Tate McDermott, who have played ahead of him in the first two Tests.“Pulling on the gold jersey was a dream of mine when I was a young boy in Scone and to say I’ve done it 72 times, with one last crack on Saturday night, is something I’m incredibly proud of and a privilege I’ve never taken for granted,” White said.“Rugby has given me so much to be grateful for. I’ve made some incredible memories, some lifelong friendships and had the opportunity to see the world.”Schmidt described White as “the ultimate competitor”. “First and foremost Nic is a great man to have in a squad,” he said. “He’s team first all the time and has been at the top of the game for over a decade.”Outside White, Tom Lynagh at flyhalf and the centre pairing of Len Ikitau and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii keep their places, while Dylan Pietsch will replace the injured Harry Potter on the wing.There are more changes in the forwards, as tighthead prop Taniela Tupou replaces Allan Alaalatoa who is out with a shoulder complaint.Rob Valetini will miss the game as the staff manage his return from a calf injury, after he lasted only 40 minutes in Melbourne.Into the loose forwards comes Tom Hooper to play alongside Queensland pair Fraser McReight and Harry Wilson who was again named captain, and prop Zane Noongar has been brought on to the bench.Carlo Tizzano and Tom Robertson have dropped off the bench, which has a five-three split including the recalled Andrew Kellaway.Schmidt said the squad has been “deflated” after the “gut-wrenching” end to the Test in Melbourne, when a contentious last-minute try won the Lions the match and the series, but they have now put that experience behind them.“They have started to gather momentum in the back half of the week and will be ready to go again on Saturday,” he said.“The support in Brisbane and Melbourne helped to lift the squad, and I know the support this weekend in Accor Stadium, will again help to lift the players in the high-pressure moments that we know are coming.”The 83,000-capacity stadium is sold out for the clash, as the Wallabies hope to avoid their first whitewash against the Lions since 1904.Wallabies: 15-Tom Wright, 14-Max Jorgensen, 13-Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, 12-Len Ikitau, 11-Dylan Pietsch, 10-Tom Lynagh, 9-Nic White, 8-Harry Wilson, 7-Fraser McReight, 6-Tom Hooper, 5-Will Skelton, 4-Nick Frost, 3-Taniela Tupou, 2-David Porecki, 1-James SlipperReplacements: 16-Billy Pollard, 17-Angus Bell, 18-Zane Nonggorr, 19-Jeremy Williams, 20-Langi Gleeson, 21-Tate McDermott, 22-Ben Donaldson, 23-Andrew Kellaway",

    "content": "Blair Kinghorn and James Ryan have been named to start for the British & Irish Lions in their third Test against the Wallabies in Sydney on Saturday as Andy Farrell’s side seek to wrap up a series whitewash.Kinghorn is selected on the left wing with James Lowe dropping out of the 23 while Ryan replaces Ollie Chessum, who has been named on the bench. Kinghorn impressed as a replacement in the last-gasp victory in Melbourne last week and though he is a fullback by trade, he often appears on the wing for Toulouse.Ryan also caught the eye off the bench at the MCG and comes into the starting XV alongside Maro Itoje, who continues as captain. Ryan is one of nine Ireland players selected along with Tadhg Furlong who will equal Alun Wyn Jones in starting nine consecutive Tests for the Lions. Itoje will also appear in his ninth straight Lions Test, having made his debut off the bench in New Zealand in 2017.Lowe pays the price for indifferent form in the first two Tests but Farrell has resisted making wholesale changes to his side which will bid to become the first to complete a series whitewash since 1927 and the first to go unbeaten since 1974. It means that Sione Tuipulotu again misses out with Bundee Aki and Huw Jones keeping their places in midfield.It is unclear whether Joe McCarthy was deemed fit to play, having missed the second Test with a foot injury, but Ryan is rewarded for his form of late after a slow start to the tour. On the bench, Owen Farrell is again selected as part of a 6-2 split with Ben Earl also recalled, having missed out in Melbourne.Up front Furlong is joined by Leinster teammates Dan Sheehan and Andrew Porter again while Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry and Jack Conan keep their places in the back-row. Jamison Gibson-Park and Finn Russell are again the halfbacks while Tommy Freeman stays on the right wing and Hugo Keenan is once more named at fullback after his last-minute try sealed the series win last week.On the bench, Ellis Genge, Ronan Kelleher and Will Stuart again provide front-row cover while Chessum, Jac Morgan and Earl complete the forwards contingent. Joining Farrell among the backs is Alex Mitchell, who has now been named in every squad on the tour.“We have put ourselves in a great position to finish this Tour with our best performance to date and create our own piece of history,” Andy Farrell said. “Last weekend’s Test match in Melbourne was an incredible spectacle and illustrated how special Lions Tours are and what they mean to both the players and the supporters. We are expecting another epic battle this weekend against a Wallaby side that showed their quality last week.”",

    "content": "Welcome to England, India. Or at least, welcome to the England their batters might have expected when touching down at the start of June. Cloud cover, stoppages for rain, and seamers operating on a green-tinged surface — the opening day at the Oval was certainly a far cry from what came before.And yet by the time stumps came at 7.30pm the tourists had scrapped their way to a serviceable 204 for six from 64 overs and it was England who were feeling a bit glum. Though the hosts went into this series decider 2-1 up, a late injury to Chris Woakes took the shine off a day that, until that point, had been all about Gus Atkinson’s stellar return on his home ground.Figures of two for 31 from 19 overs did not tell the full story of Atkinson’s day either. Arguably the most important strike witnessed came not from his brand of waspish fast-medium but a sparkling run out of Shubman Gill for 21 in a six-over mini-session between the afternoon showers. Given the glowing form India’s captain has been in this series, it felt like a defining moment.It was a hugely self-inflicted dismissal too, Gill having dropped Atkinson into the off side with a defensive prod and set off for a single that was simply never on. Turning on his heels but already in trouble, he could only look on as Atkinson swooped in, took aim, and threw down the stumps with unerring precision. The look of anguish on Gill’s face as he walked off was palpable.But Gill’s despair was later trumped by that of Woakes and what may also be greater by way of significance. The only English seamer to push through all five Tests, Woakes had chased a ball to the rope only to fall awkwardly in the process. A dislocated left shoulder appears the likely upshot here, the 36-year-old walking off in agony with his arm in a makeshift sling.Standing in for the injured captain Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope now faces the prospect of juggling three seamers for the remainder of the match, and only the part time spin of Jacob Bethell and Joe Root offering scope for a breather. And though Atkinson impressed, pinning Yashasvi Jaiswal lbw for two and getting Dhruv Jurel caught in the cordon for 19, Pope will need Josh Tongue and Jamie ­Overton to offer more than they did on day one.Because as much as England were happy to claim six wickets, there is a case to say that it should have been more. Lee Fortis, chief groundsman and scourge of the tourists in the build-up, had left 8mm of grass on the Oval pitch – ideal conditions to lock in on a length and let the Dukes do its thing. And yet this was something the support cast struggled to achieve at times.In the case of the fast but often wayward Tongue, perhaps this is missing the point. England like the point of difference he offers and, while he sprayed wides for fun in the morning, his best remains very good indeed. His two wickets on the day, Sai Sudharsan for 38 and Ravindra Jadeja for nine, were both a case of rip-snorting deliveries being edged behind.Overton, however, looks a curious selection on a surface that might be better suited to Matthew Potts or Sam Cook. While his speeds picked up from some initial 80mph long hops, and swing was harnessed, figures of nought for 66 were the weak link in the attack – a link that must be strengthened swiftly if Woakes spends the remainder of the match on the sidelines.Atkinson, back from a hamstring injury, appears to have picked up where he left off at least. His removal of Jaiswal was also a notable feat for his Surrey teammate, Pope, who sent a decision upstairs for the 14th time as a stand-in captain and finally saw one go his way. Going by the celebrations – Pope beaming, wry smiles in the dressing room – everyone was fully aware.Although the removal of KL Rahul for 14 an hour into play arguably had greater value, such has been the right-hander’s proficiency against the moving ball in England. Replacing Atkinson from the Pavilion End after a tight six-over opening spell, Woakes persuaded Rahul to chop on to his stumps with a bit of nip – even if it was always too tight to cut.In the end, with Gill having lost his fifth toss in a row, India were grateful to another experienced campaigner for steering them out of choppy waters. Recalled after his omission at Old Trafford, Karun Nair turned things around from 153 for six at the fall of Jurel’s wicket with a classy unbeaten 52 from 98 balls. Support here came from Washington Sundar, who made 19 not out.England know all about Sundar, of course, but open up an end first thing and India’s tail will begin. Problem is, even with the forecast in London set to improve and batting conditions with it, taking 10 wickets second time around will be a significant challenge if the fears about poor Woakes are accurate.",
    "summary": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of the article:\n\nIndia ended the first day of the series-deciding test match against England with a respectable 204 for six, despite being under pressure for much of the day. England's Gus Atkinson made a stellar return on his home ground, taking two for 31 and also running out India's Shubman Gill in a crucial moment. However, England's celebrations were dampened by a late injury to Chris Woakes, which could impact their chances in the match.",

    "content": "The hottest property in the AFL happens to have the coolest head in the game. St Kilda sensation Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera completed his sparkling rise from a damaging defender and one of the most exciting midfielders in the competition, to a proven match-winner after icing two goals in the final minute that sealed a historic comeback against Melbourne.The 22-year-old has already shown he can do it all at both ends. But it is rare for a player to have a game-changing impact in all areas of the field in one game, let alone in a single breathtaking quarter that helped turn Sunday’s contest. Wanganeen-Milera started the game taking on the Demons’ decorated on-ball brigade, but with the Saints trailing by 46 points at the final change he was soon taking the kick ins, connecting play through the midfield and drifting forward to be a target in attack.The defender-turned-allrounder gathered 10 disposals as the Saints came from the clouds to chase down the Demons in the final term. But it is Wanganeen-Milera’s last minute of action at Marvel Stadium that will go down in folklore. It is a tale that even the humble Saints star struggled to explain.“I don’t know, I’m a bit speechless,” Wanganeen-Milera told Channel 7 immediately after the game. “It just sort of happened, I flew for it. But my teammates did a great job in the last quarter, the pressure was unreal, we just kept fighting and fighting.”The Demons led by a goal with less than a minute left on the clock when Saints midfielder Mason Wood received a handball after a boundary throw-in on the wing and bombed the ball into the forward 50. Wanganeen-Milera first made his name as a rebounding half-back and has shown plenty of promise since moving into the midfield, but with the game on the line he soared over Bailey Fritsch to pull down a screamer in front of Demons defender Judd McVee within sight of goal.The exquisitely skilled Wanganeen-Milera could hardly have split the middle better as he nailed the set shot to level the scores with only eight seconds remaining and leave the Saints looking like the only side thinking about victory. While the young St Kilda players were calm and composed amid the chaos that followed, even the most experienced Demons lost their heads as they turned the ball over with a 6-6-6 infringement for not having enough players set up in each area of the ground.The Saints trio of Rowan Marshall, Marcus Windhager and Wanganeen-Milera quickly concocted a plan at the centre bounce for the ruck to take the free kick and pick out the man of the moment charging forward. A pinpoint pass from Marshall was enough to find Wanganeen-Milera just inside the 50m arc as he bravely marked while falling backwards. He sprang back to his feet before the siren sounded. “I just told the forwards, ‘get out of my way’, and then I told Rowan, ‘just hit me on the left side’, and it was lucky I got on the end of it,” Wanganeen-Milera said.With the result resting on his young shoulders, Wanganeen-Milera only needed a point to clinch the greatest comeback from a three-quarter-time deficit in VFL/AFL history. It was no surprise to see his lethal right foot send the ball through the middle again for the icing on the cake of a stunning six-point triumph. Wanganeen-Milera finished with 34 disposals, nine score involvements, six clearances and a career-high four goals in just the latest display as his career keeps reaching for new heights.If only to add to the mythical performance, coach Ross Lyon revealed after the game that the Saints’ hero of the day was on the brink of being a late withdrawal from the game due to a stye in his eye before getting the all-clear from the club doctor. “[The doctor] said ‘Nas has come in, [we’ve] upped his antibiotics, given him an injection,” Lyon said. “I mean, they can sound quite morbid at times, the doctors. I just said, ‘how’s Nas’, he’s pretty confident. Then I rang him, he goes, ‘no, I’ll be right’. But I just said, if you’re not right, no pressure, we’ll tap you out.” There will be a sense of relief as much as elation around the Saints’ camp that Wanganeen-Milera was available to take on the Demons, but both will only grow if the speedster commits his long-term future to the club.The stepson of former St Kilda player Terry Milera and nephew of former Port Adelaide and Essendon great Gavin Wanganeen owns the most sought-after signature in the game, as he comes out of contract while being courted by both clubs in his home state of South Australia. Wanganeen-Milera has already ensured that St Kilda are etched in the record books for their fightback, but the club that drafted him at No 11 in 2021 AFL draft live in hope that his incredible performance against Melbourne was just one of many memorable moments to come in red, white and black.",

    "content": "Football will return to Victorian free-to-air television on Saturdays to mark the start of the AFLW season, but the first three rounds will be split across Channel Seven’s main and secondary channels in a sign the broadcaster is not fully convinced of the competition’s ability to draw ratings.The AFL has faced criticism this season for its new broadcast deal which has given Saturday’s men’s matches exclusively to Foxtel in Victoria, in an attempt to increase Thursday night coverage on Seven.While Seven is still finalising its AFLW programming, only the season-opening Thursday night double-header of Carlton v Collingwood followed by West Coast v Gold Coast, as well as Sunday afternoon slots, are set be shown to Victorians on Seven’s main channel over the first three rounds.The qualified support for the women’s code from Seven comes as AFL head office seeks to accelerate growth in a competition entering its tenth season, and address negative perceptions about the AFLW.On Tuesday, the AFL chief executive, Andrew Dillon, rejected the language used in a story in the Age earlier this month which claimed the AFL told clubs at a CEOs’ meeting that the AFLW was “losing $50m” each year.“That’s certainly not a line that’s ever been run by the AFL, we have a big investment in AFLW, but it’s an investment absolutely worth making,” Dillon said. “You can talk about direct profit and losses, but I think what’s also important when you look at a competition like AFLW, [are] the indirect benefits that we have from having an elite women’s competition.”The comments appeared to be a stern response to a persistent rhetoric from some in the AFL industry who see the women’s competition as a waste of resources. Dillon said people shouldn’t forget the impact of the AFLW on helping clubs win grants to build new clubrooms, attract new sponsors and retain female fans.This year will see the men’s and women’s seasons overlap, triggering a first-ever 18-match mega round. Last AFLW season began during the AFL’s pre-finals bye weekend, but this year’s first round coincides with round 23 of the AFL. However, the women’s competition will still be be prominent on free-to-air, with 11 of 27 matches over the first three rounds screened on Seven and 7plus nationally. All matches until the finals are shown on Foxtel/Kayo.Dillon this week highlighted the progress in AFLW, given it was conceived barely more than a decade ago: “If you’d said that we would be here 10 or 11 years later with 18 teams with 30 players, being the [league with the] most professional female athletes employed in Australia, and the fourth-highest combined salary cap of any sport in Australia – men’s or women’s – I would have said you were crazy.”But when asked for his reflections on the league’s priorities, he instead offered a nostalgic perspective of the early years, when fans came to largely unticketed venues in their droves.“If we can make that match-day experience as compelling, as engaging maybe as it was in years one and two where there was just so much joy in the game … ” he began saying at an AFL summit of hundreds of club staff on Tuesday, before amending his language. “ … Not that there’s not [joy today], but I think that’s something if we can rediscover that – I wouldn’t say it’s a hidden gem because it’s really well known – but I think that we’ve got a really solid base from which we can grow.”About 200,000 attended the 29 matches in the first season in 2017, including almost 25,000 to Carlton v Collingwood at Ikon Park for the historic opening match. The inaugural season had an average crowd of close to 7,000 according to website Austadiums. Last year, 108 fully ticketed matches attracted more than 290,000 fans, but at an average of less than 3,000 a match.The competition now appears better set up for the longer term. The league is now settled into its late winter/spring window. The compressed fixture of last year has been scrapped, and matches in 2025 have been given traditional timeslots. There are no midweek fixtures and there has been an effort to build rituals into the season such as Indigenous round and Pride , as well as capitalising on the men’s grand final week when the Geelong women play at home on Thursday night before four AFLW matches in Melbourne on the Friday public holiday.Despite the hopes of some players and the construction of new change rooms at the MCG, there will be no double-headers with the AFL. Rather, officials are trusting that the athleticism and skill of AFLW athletes, some who have now played for 10 seasons, together with a refined marketing strategy will be enough draw more fans to mostly suburban grounds, and offer a television product that repays the faith of Channel Seven.“It will be really interesting to see how the two-week overlap goes this year in terms of attendance at games and viewership,” Dillon said. “But I feel it’s a competition and it’s a game that deserves its own time and its time to shine.”",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe AFLW season will return to free-to-air television on Saturdays in Victoria, but initially, only some matches will be shown on Channel Seven's main channel, with others airing on its secondary channel. This split broadcast schedule suggests that Channel Seven is not entirely confident in the competition's ratings appeal. The AFL is seeking to grow the women's competition and address negative perceptions as it enters its tenth season.",

    "content": "Nothing does irony quite like Test cricket. Say what you like about the world’s most desiccated, Miss Havisham-ish team sport, out there trailing around the post-colonial world still dressed in its yellowing wedding dress. It’s definitely got a sense of humour.On day one of the fifth England-India Test this was expressed in cosmic terms, and a single bold and improbable dramatic arc. Talk about groundsmen a lot. Tell groundsmen they’re nothing. One thing is for sure. You’re going to find yourself spending quite a lot of time watching groundsmen.Or in this case watching the personage we must now refer to as controversial groundsman Lee Fortis, celebrity Oval pitch curator Lee Fortis, an otherwise peripheral figure with a name that sounds like an Anglo-Saxon burial site in Norfolk, but who was promoted in the buildup to this Test into an instrument of the sporting-political power struggle.And so it came to pass in the first two sessions at the Oval, as India and England traipsed on and off between the showers, and Fortis loomed, somehow inevitably, centre stage. Here is Lee Fortis striding about his domain in classic shorts and boots combos, like a proud, captive bear. Here is Lee Fortis tugging at a tarpaulin.Here is Lee Fortis all alone in his lime green field as the drizzle fell and the walkways around the ground took on the feel of a slowly sinking ship peopled only by pint-sozzled mariners in chino shorts, and watched from behind the plateglass by his chief adversary, India’s head coach, Gautam Gambhir. In a Test series shot through with politics, rumblings and noises off, they’ve finally dragged in the bloke with the rake. Welcome to the Fortis-verse.It is the most unlikely turn of events. Fortis is familiar figure around here, a huge ambling man with the classic groundsman’s shape, as though he’s been hinged together out of sacks of cement and packed into a pair of shorts. Who thinks of the groundsman? What are they? They sit on mowers. They walk with sawdust buckets. They follow the seasons, disturbed only by their personal kryptonite, people walking near a rope, signal for instant and uncontainable explosions of boggle-eyed fury.And yet, look a little closer, squint at the magic eye picture, and something else has begun to emerge here, the groundsman as instrument of power and conspiracy. By 2pm on Thursday afternoon, 48 hours on from that unnecessary spat with Gambhir, Fortis had been memed and replicated and spun out across the global hive mind.Oval curator breaks silence. Fortis v Gambhir: the full story. Who is Lee Fortis and what does he mean? There are Fortis YouTube clips (jerky spat footage; weird ad hoc media huddle) that have been viewed two million times. Lee Fortis stuns fans with body transformation. This simple Lee Fortis trick will change your life for ever. Seventeen times Lee Fortis broke the internet (No 12 will shock you!)More fuel was added overnight as R Ashwin labelled Fortis a habitual offender. Really? It’s not the first time he’s yelled at people to get off his square? You shock me. Meanwhile, the groundsman community has sprung to his defence, a Facebook page speaking for this maligned minority demanding respect, understanding, a safe space for its members. What next? A Fortis spin-off vehicle. The Fortis origins story. A Fortis male grooming range. Jake Paul calls out Lee Fortis in sensational Vegas standoff.Or perhaps it won’t come to that. Because this is at the same time absolutely nothing, chaff, gossip, and also a grim little episode that reflects poorly on Gambhir in particular; and perhaps also on the general power dynamics of elite cricket in its current form.The initial incident was a standard stramash over practising too close, or so Fortis said, to the square. Gambhir’s response was furious. Any situation where you end up wagging a finger and shouting, “You’re nothing, you’re just a groundsman, nothing beyond that,” is one that has lost any sense of scale.Later Fortis was swarmed by Indian journalists and gave the greatest no comment interview of all time, unveiling a technique that should be urgently coached to all celebrities and politicians, which basically involves just saying “I’m not ... You’re not ... I’m not really,” to every question.It is a fairly simple divvying up at this point. Gambhir was always in the wrong here. First because all groundsmen are grumpy. They have to venerate, love and fetishise this patch of green. They have the artist’s temperament. They feel the hand of history. They basically just want you to stay off their square and stop playing cricket.But mainly Gambhir was wrong because of the ugliness of his choice of words, and the sense of punching down. England got to show their boorishness in Manchester. This was India’s turn. India’s coach is a born-to-rule type, high caste Hindu, private schoolboy, son of a wealthy industrialist, BJP politician, a Jay Shah man, a Modi guy. It sits a little uncomfortably to hear anyone with such privilege dismissing a bloke with a bucket as “nothing”, unqualified to make demands of his betters.In this context Gambhir v Fortis speaks, if you choose to see it, to the way India wields its commercial and political power in this sport; to the sense that here is an overlord nation that can basically do what it wants, that is in effect untouchable. This is the most unfavourable version of events. More prosaically Gambhir does just love a fight, is essentially a grudge in a cap, outspoken and commendably feisty.In a happier turn there was at least a kind of rapprochement at the start of play between Fortis and India’s players, a little wary banter and some smiles. After which, once the showers had cleared, it was a case of the groundsman’s revenge, as Gambhir got to watch India’s batters sparring and hopping and nicking as the ball leapt and jagged about on Fortis’ chosen strip.England’s pace attack had looked rusty at the start, both Jamie Overton and Josh Tongue perhaps paying tribute the 2.5m distance rule by almost missing the cut part of the pitch. But they chipped away and found movement. Shubman Gill had batted with sculpted elegance, all perfect arms, shoulders, lines, balletic in the way he shifts his weight, then ran himself out trying to take a single to Gus Atkinson’s right hand in his follow through.With India on 204 for six at the end of play the series already felt a little safer. Hopefully the age of Lee is also done. Andy Warhol would later revise his most famous line to the more depressingly accurate “in 15 minutes everyone will be famous”. Fortis had his day in the gloom. With any luck hands will now be shaken, an unpleasant tone revised, and the whole thing can be safely packed away in the shed behind the pigeon nets.",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe fifth England-India Test match featured a dramatic plot twist on its first day, centered around Lee Fortis, the groundsman at the Oval cricket ground. Fortis, a relatively minor figure, became an unlikely focal point due to a sporting-political power struggle. He was watched closely by his adversaries as he tended to the pitch on a rainy day, becoming an \"instrument\" of the conflict.",

    "content": "Andy Farrell has described suggestions the Wallabies are not worthy opponents of the British & Irish Lions as “insulting” and believes it would be a mistake to scrap tours of Australia.The Lions can wrap up their first clean sweep since 1927 if they beat the Wallabies in Saturday’s third Test in Sydney and become the first Lions side to go unbeaten since 1974. The Lions have already made history by becoming the first touring side to clinch a second straight series win over the same opponent and are odds-on favourites to secure a 3-0 whitewash.The Wallabies are languishing at sixth in the world rankings and although they came within 50 seconds of levelling the series in Melbourne were well beaten in the Brisbane opener. The six warm-up victories have been largely one-sided – the five-point win over the First Nations & Pasifika XV notwithstanding – raising questions as to whether the Lions should continue to tour Australia or seek different opponents, such as France or Argentina.The French federation vice-president Abdel Benazzi said this month that he intended to discuss a “new business model” with the Lions. Benazzi was adamant he did not want to do so at the expense of Australia, but Sir Clive Woodward, who coached the Lions in 2005, and Brian Moore, who featured on two tours, have said consideration should be given to scheduling different opponents.Australia’s head coach, Joe Schmidt, chose not to release a number of his players to feature in the warm-up games and this provided more ammunition. The 2029 tour of New Zealand is all but signed off, but there is no agreement in place over future tours.The Lions captain, Maro Itoje, said on Tuesday that his preference would be to stick with the traditional opponents and on Thursday Farrell said: “I don’t think [touring Australia] was ever off the agenda. Every single team, country, province, has their ups and downs, but Australia – the sporting nation they are – are always going to come back.“That [performance last] weekend is no surprise to us and why we expect them to be better. Have a look at the year they’ve got coming up. They’re going to be a force to be reckoned with, 100%, with all their experiences, come the World Cup in 2027 [in Australia].“Hopefully, [this tour] will be remembered for the type of rugby we played and the way that we went about it. We came here and wanted to win a series. We’ve achieved that, but we have a massive responsibility to make sure we finish this off with something we promised ourselves with.“It’s a big ask, but it’s something that we’re determined to do. [Winning 3-0 is] something we’ve talked about from day one and we’ve put ourselves in a position to put that on the line, so that’s why it means so much to us.”Despite already securing the series, Farrell has resisted making wholesale changes for the final Test with just two to the starting lineup. Blair Kinghorn replaces James Lowe on the left wing while James Ryan comes in at second-row. Ollie Chessum drops to a 6-2 bench that includes Jac Morgan and Ben Earl.Morgan’s clearout on Carlo Tizzano in the buildup to Hugo Keenan’s last-minute try last week has been hotly debated with the Wallabies adamant the score ought to have been chalked off. Tizzano, for his part, has been accused of playacting, but Schmidt revealed on Thursday that the clearout registered a force of 54G. Schmidt has chosen to omit the flanker for the third Test and said “he’s copped a lot of online abuse”.Farrell, who lashed out when his son Owen was targeted after his red card against Wales in a 2023 World Cup warm-up match, said: “Online abuse is clear and obvious. It’s disgusting. It shouldn’t be that way.”",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nBritish & Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has defended the Wallabies as worthy opponents, calling suggestions that they are not deserving of a tour \"insulting\". The Lions are on the verge of a 3-0 whitewash against Australia, but some have questioned whether they should continue to tour the country or face different opponents like France or Argentina. Farrell believes it would be a mistake to scrap tours of Australia.",

Marchand said the record may have taken a bit out of him but he was hardly complaining.“I felt so excited yesterday that I couldn’t sleep,” he said. “So I think I lost a lot of energy yesterday night, but it was my goal to break the record, so I was really happy with it.”Popovici doublePopovici then emerged the winner of a sensational men’s 100 freestyle final, clocking 46.51 to give Pan Zhanle’s world record (46.40) a big scare.American runner-up Jack Alexy also broke the 47-second barrier (46.92), while Paris Games silver medallist Kyle Chalmers took the bronze for Australia.At 20, 200 Olympic champion Popovici has already completed the 100-200 sweep twice at world championships, having done the double at Budapest three years ago.The relaxed Romanian said he had reached a higher plain; no longer worried about winning or losing.“I just feel very relieved that this huge pressure of being afraid of winning or losing is off me,” he said.“I don’t mean it in an arrogant way, I mean it in a self-maturing way.“The United States celebrated a fourth gold in the meet as Katharine Berkoff won the 50 backstroke in 27.08 seconds, edging compatriot Smith.In the finale of Thursday’s programme, Australia’s women clinched a second relay gold as Mollie O’Callaghan held off Ledecky in a thrilling final leg to guide her 4x200 freestyle relay team over the finish line.Australia also won the men’s and women’s 4x100 freestyle golds on Sunday.O’Callaghan, whose 11th gold tied her with Ian Thorpe as the most successful Australian at the world championships, will now look to add the 100 freestyle title to her 200 crown on Friday.Medals will also be decided in the men’s 200 breaststroke, 200 backstroke and 4x200 freestyle relay, as well as the women’s 200 breaststroke.",

American Jack Alexy (46.81) topped the semi-final times.And the Dolphins medal tally received an unexpected boost when 21-year-old Turner snared bronze in the men’s 200m fly.The 21-year-old former cross-country athlete snuck into the final in lane eight and then produced an Australian record of 1:54.17 in a race won by American Luca Urlando (1:51.87).“I looked up on the board and I had to look there for a bit. I was like: ‘Does it say third?’,” Turner said. “It’s just unreal.”Australia’s mixed 4x100m medley team of Kaylee McKeown, Nash Wilkes, Matt Temple and Milla Jansen finished fifth.Also on Wednesday night, French star Leon Marchand broke the men’s 200m medley world record.Marchand clocked 1:52.69 in a semi-final, well inside American Ryan Lochte’s previous benchmark of 1:54.00 set in 2011.Meanwhile at the diving world titles held concurrently in Singapore, Australian duo Cassiel Rousseau and Maddison Keeney won silver in the mixed 3m springboard synchro on Wednesday night.The silver was Keeney’s second medal of the championships after winning 1m springboard gold last Saturday.",

    "content": "The Wallabies were brave in Melbourne but the true test of their courage comes now. Despite snatching defeat from the jaws of victory yet again, they must try to put aside the disappointment of the last-gasp 29-26 defeat at the MCG and debate over that contentious 80th minute non-penalty, and win the final Test to deny the Lions a 3-0 sweep. The Wallabies can’t save the series but they can save face in Sydney on Saturday – and claw back a little of the goodwill they squandered in letting the Lions off the hook with 90,307 fans in the stands and millions more watching on screens at home.It won’t be easy. All week Australians have torn themselves apart wrestling with one of the crueller defeats in the Wallabies’ woebegone recent history. Moods have swung between grieving and aggrieved, despair and defiance. On one hand the wider public are mourning a gut-wrenching defeat, a once-every-12-years opportunity lost amid an embarrassing, yet painfully familiar, inability to ruthlessly close out a game they were bossing with a 23-5 lead. On the other hand they are still aggrieved that Australia’s early dominance over the Lions was denied at the death by a 50-50 decision.Carlo Tizzano’s theatrics – reeling from the contact with operatic passion, hands clutching the back of his head in mock-agony – have also polarised. Was this cowardly “diving” or canny gamesmanship to catch the camera’s eye? Alas, Italian referee Andrea Piardi sang only from the song sheet of officialdom. He ignored Tizzano’s squatter’s rights to the ball in the ruck to reward Jac Morgan’s lethal clean-out a split second later.In the chaos, the Wallabies lost possession. The Lions cleared to the left and found space for Hugo Keenan to scramble over the line. Game over. Series won – and lost. For Wallabies fans who have endured a torrid two decades of decline, it was another cruel blow. But not an undeserving one. Australia had tempted the fates when young fly-half Tom Lynagh coughed up a kick under no pressure to spark two Lions tries that saw Australia’s 18-point ascendancy vanish into a slender six-point buffer at the break.Yes, Piardi’s decision had denied Australia a penalty that would’ve secured victory and squared the series one-all. But sport is built on drama, not justice. Rugby clings to respect for the referee as sacrosanct. Both captains Harry Wilson and Maro Itoje addressed Piardi as “sir” throughout (even though the honorary title often gets lost in a torrent of profanity afterwards). For all its wine-producing and guzzling, sour grapes are not Australia’s go. This, after all, is the land of “cop it sweet”.The real cost for the Wallabies was bottling a golden chance to win back floating fans with a famous victory at the nation’s most storied colosseum. With a World Cup to host in 2027, Australian rugby badly needed a boilover victory against an all-star touring side to give Joe Schmidt’s ragged band of players a jolt of confidence before another arduous Rugby Championship against the All Blacks, South Africa and Argentina starting on 17 August.Instead, the opportunity for a week of fever pitch anticipation for a decider before more than 80,000 fans at the former Olympic stadium has been lost. Worse, the largely self-inflicted calamity in Melbourne has reopened old wounds of other near-victories cruelly vaporised – Kurtley Beale slipping in the mud to gift the 2013 Lions their first series win in 16 years, Bernard Foley penalised for time wasting when the Wallabies had the All Blacks on the rack in 2022.Are the Wallabies cursed? Former Socceroo Johnny Warren claimed an unpaid debt led a Mozambique witch-doctor to put a hex on Australian soccer in 1970 and led to a series of bizarre losses and a 32-year World Cup exile. Melbourne Demons fans swore the sacking of legendary coach Norm Smith in 1965 sparked the club’s premiership drought until 2021. Footballers are superstitious creatures. In theatre circles it’s unlucky to say “Macbeth” before a performance and apparently these Wallabies won’t utter the name “Eddie Jones” aloud for fear of ghosting by their old coach.But superstition is borne from fear. The Wallabies must banish any demons from Melbourne and set their jaws for a last stand with these hungry Lions, not for their sake as much as ours. US basketball coach Dick Motta used to tell his troops “you cannot find victory unless you first understand defeat … but show me a good loser in pro sport and I’ll show you an idiot.” Australian fans are sick of lionising brave defeats and Schmidt can’t shrug off the loss in Melbourne if he’s to win Sydney. As the NRL and AFL close in, winning a “dead rubber” in front of a full house keeps Wallabies hope alive.",

    "content": "Sitting in a car wash with the windows jammed open would be marginally drier than walking the streets of Sydney this week. The forecast rain stayed away for the decisive second Test in Melbourne, but the outlook for the Accor Stadium on Saturday is properly damp. Not that the Lions are overly bothered as they seek to squeeze every last drop of joy out of their tour of Australia.From the moment they met up the mantra of this party has been based on showing the absolute best of themselves in the Test matches and winning the series 3-0. Nothing has changed in that regard, as reflected in Farrell’s largely rinse‑and-repeat final-Test selection, with the exception of Blair Kinghorn and James Ryan being elevated to the starting XV and a forward-loaded 6-2 bench split.As anyone with knowledge of Farrell’s competitive instincts will be aware, the chances of him easing off the downcast Wallabies at this late juncture were always on the nonexistent side of slim. A final flourish is not always easily achieved at the end of a long, punishing season, but, in this case, all the most influential Lions are fit and hungry and motivation is not a problem.Aside from enjoying each other’s company, the players have also responded well to Farrell’s management style, among the primary reasons why this large tour party has stayed fully united. “He’s been really good at getting everyone closer,” said the Scotland centre Huw Jones, set to become a member of a prestigious Lions club by starting all three Tests. “I don’t really know how he’s done it, but it’s worked.“I wasn’t really sure what to expect from the outside. He’s very calm and relaxed a lot of the time, [but] when he’s on, he’s pretty intense. When we’re training he’s always on and doesn’t miss a beat. He sees everything and he’s prepared to call you out in the middle of the session if something’s not good enough.“There’s no hiding place, his standards are so high. He’s very clear about what he wants and how he wants you to do it. He’s been brilliant and it’s great to be part of the squad under that leadership.”Jones, who will again partner Bundee Aki in midfield, was also good value on the subject of Farrell’s presence and rugby instincts. “He doesn’t need to try to be intimidating, he just is. Some people just have that presence. He’s obviously massive. Without meaning to be, he’s just an intimidating person. Not in a bad way, but in a good way that commands respect. When he speaks everyone is listening. I’m yet to hear him say something I don’t agree with, he reads the game so well.“If you are walking, haven’t quite got into position or if you are not talking to someone he will pick it up … and you will know about it. It is about not accepting anything average or mediocre you may be able to get away with at your club. We are here because we were selected as being the best of our international teams. You have to show up and prove that every day.”A resounding final performance, accordingly, is the objective of all concerned, Farrell included. When he says winning 3-0 “would mean the world to us” he is reiterating his belief that aiming high is vital, in sport and life.“I never think you should shy away from shooting for the stars because you might end up on the moon,” he said. “That’s pretty good as well.“What’s there to be shy about? Players, coaches, staff, Lions fans, everyone … they all want to win every game. You can’t be frightened of that.”Just as telling, perhaps, is that even the 16 unlucky individuals – 12 original selections and four replacements – who have had no involvement in the Tests have felt as much a part of campaign as the 27 who have. “It touches you,” said Farrell. “The ones that were celebrating most last Saturday were the ones who hadn’t put the shirt on. That says it all.”All that remains, then, is for the chosen few to go out and apply the coup de grace. In the first half in Brisbane and the second half in Melbourne these Lions have shown what they can do; not so much at other times. On this occasion, Farrell would settle for 70 minutes of excellence that, on the evidence to date, should be enough: “We know what we’re capable of in all sorts of areas, so getting close to eight or nine out of 10 in all of them would be somewhere close to where we want to be.”Jones feels much the same as he prepares for his own final fling. “We’ve probably not played to our full capacity yet. That’s been the message this week: to try and have our best performance of the tour. To do it in the last game, to win 3-0 – that would be amazing. That’s where the motivation is.”It takes more than a spot of rain to dilute the resolve of Farrell and co.",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe British and Irish Lions are set to play the final Test match of their tour of Australia against the Wallabies on Saturday, with the forecast predicting rain. Despite the wet conditions, the Lions are motivated to win the series 3-0 and are fielding a strong team, with only two changes to the starting XV. Coach Warren Farrell's management style has helped keep the team united and hungry for a win, with the players eager to give it their all in the final match.",

    "content": "Dan Sheehan freely admits that his Superman dive for the British & Irish Lions’ first try in Melbourne last week was not out of the playbook. It was an instinctive finish to avoid getting “melted”, putting the Lions on the board in Melbourne and taking the hooker’s remarkable season tally to 17 in 19 games.It has been eclipsed by the furore over Jac Morgan’s late clearout, but there is debate over whether Sheehan’s try was legal. He acknowledges the controversy but sees no problem with his crucial score all the while admitting some sympathy with Wallaby defenders.The debate centres on the lawbook’s insistence that players cannot jump to avoid a tackle. After he was rebuffed by Australia with a tap and go not long before, Sheehan was given another chance in the 15th minute and dived over his opposite number, Dave Porecki. As he was in the act of scoring, the referee, Andrea Piardi, awarded the try.A World Rugby clarification issued in 2022 states that: “A ball carrier may dive with the ball in order to score a try, and we all agree that should be allowed. From an equity perspective, if they do so, a defender may attempt to make a safe and legal tackle on that player.”In other words, Australia defenders were permitted to tackle Sheehan when he was airborne but because Porecki and James Slipper had both gone low they were left ­floundering. The Wallabies’ head coach, Joe Schmidt, questioned how his players could have tackled Sheehan safely but stopped short of claiming the try should have been disallowed.“I can see all the controversy about it, but I did know that you can dive in the air if you score,” said Sheehan. “I’m not sure actually if I missed the line would it be a penalty or not? I feel like I was at full stretch and landed over the line so why not? It would have been a penalty as well probably if they actually caught me high. It’s a tough job in professional rugby.“It was not the play. The play was trying to get as close to the line as possible for the second phase. I just thought in my head I got melted in the first one and didn’t get much out of it, that there has to be a bit of an opportunity over the top.“I took the first [tap and go] and I got absolutely melted trying to go low. Usually, one lad goes low and someone maybe is high and I just got both shoulders melted low and I didn’t really get much out of it. Then the second one I just thought: ‘If I have a dive here …’ I didn’t know if they had anyone in the back. It was just a throw and hope and I slipped through.”Sheehan’s try-scoring performance in Melbourne was key to the Lions wrapping up the series and backed up pre-match claims by fellow front-rower Jamie George that the Irishman is the best hooker, if not one of the best players, in the world. Sheehan has hit it off with George, as well as Luke Cowan-Dickie, and has conceded it will be a strange feeling renewing rivalries in next year’s Six Nations.“I didn’t know anyone well on a personal level before coming into the squad,” added Sheehan. “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know Dickie [Luke Cowan-Dickie] and Jamie George on the back of it. Two people I’ve obviously come up against a few times, but also looked up to when I was in my school days. It’s been really nice to get to know them.“And then there’s a few lads your own age that you’ve sort of come up through age-grades like Ollie Chessum, Ben Earl who have been a great craic around it. Seeing different sides of people where you’re not hating them all the time. It’s pretty, not surprising, you’re growing up hating these lads and then all of a sudden, you’re like, everyone’s a pretty good fella.” Sheehan picks out the post-match celebrations after Saturday’s series-clinching victory as the highlight of his tour but after a prearranged day off for the squad on Monday, the switch was flicked on Tuesday as the Lions set about preparing to complete a 3-0 whitewash over the Wallabies in Sydney on Saturday.“It’s different if the series was in the balance but I think we’ve always been pretty clear on our goals,” he said. “At the start of the campaign, [the goal] was to go unbeaten overseas and win the series 3-0. There’s a lot of people who’ve put a lot of effort into travelling out for this game and a lot of our families will be here, so there’s plenty of motivation on the line and I can only imagine what the Australians are feeling now as well. We need to make sure that we show up. We are searching for an 80-minute performance this week and we have the ability to do it.”",

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told NBC he visited the employee for an hour on Wednesday and said the man was improving.There was increased security around Tom Benson Stadium and the Pro Football Hall of Fame village.Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St Brown, Jahmyr Gibbs, David Montgomery, Penei Sewell and the rest of Detroit’s star-studded offense didn’t see any action against Los Angeles.Coach Dan Campbell’s Lions, who went one-and-done in the playoffs last season after winning a franchise-record 15 games, also sat their top two draft picks.Justin Herbert was among many of the Chargers starters rested by coach Jim Harbaugh, who led the team to a six-win turnaround and a playoff berth in his first season. Rookie running back Omarion Hampton, a first-round pick, carried twice for 9 yards.The Chargers recovered a fumble on the opening kickoff at the Lions 28 and converted the short field into a 7-0 lead.Lance made a perfect touch pass on fourth-and-2 to Will Dissly, who caught a 5-yard touchdown over a defender’s outstretched hand.After undrafted rookie cornerback Nikko Reed stepped in front of Kyle Allen’s sideline pass and returned it 60 yards to the Lions 6, Kimani Vidal ran in from the 2 to make it 14-0.Allen threw another pick on the next possession to Tony Jefferson after driving the Lions to the Chargers 23.Craig Reynolds’ thee-yard TD run cut Detroit’s deficit in half.But Lance fired a 19-yard pass to Tucker Fisk to the Lions 19 and connected with KeAndre Lambert-Smith on a 15-yard TD pass for a 21-7 halftime lead.Lance has started just five games in four NFL seasons after playing in only 19 games at North Dakota State. He spent just two seasons with the 49ers, who selected Brock Purdy with the last pick the same year they traded three first-round picks and a third-rounder to move up to get Lance.After two years with Dallas, Lance joined the Chargers to compete with veteran Taylor Heinicke for the backup job. He completed 13 of 20 passes before giving way to rookie DJ Uiagalelei.Allen and Hendon Hooker are battling for the Lions’ backup job behind Goff. Allen was 9 of 14 with two picks. Hooker, a third-round pick in 2023, has thrown nine passes in his first two seasons.Detroit’s sloppy special teams turned it over again in the third quarter. Jakobie Keeney-James dropped a punt inside the 10 and the Chargers recovered at the 5. But Los Angeles had to settle for Cameron Dicker’s 23-yard field goal.The Chargers capped the scoring on Vidal’s two-yard TD run late in the fourth quarter.Lions star edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson told NBC in the second half he can’t wait for Week 1 against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.Hutchinson had seven and a half sacks in five games last season before he went down with a leg injury.Before the game, Hutchinson spent time signing autographs for Lions fans who made the trip.Dicker, who was 39 of 42 on field goals last year and 9 of 11 from 50 yards or beyond, hit the left upright on a 50-yard try. He made his next two field goals.Cornerback Eric Allen, defensive end Jared Allen, tight end Antonio Gates and wide receiver Sterling Sharpe will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.",

    "content": "As Tameka Yallop unfurled the purple scroll revealing the Matildas’ final group-stage opponent for next year’s Asian Cup, whispers rustled across the Sydney Town Hall crowd.South Korea. The same team that had knocked them out of the quarter-final of this tournament almost four years ago. The game that plunged Australian football fans and media into despair.Memories of India came rushing back. Furious calls for head coach sackings underlined widespread astonishment and growing concern over the direction of the team with a World Cup on the horizon.The Matildas were, after all, close to full-strength then. Sam Kerr and Caitlin Foord were reaching their attacking peaks, Mary Fowler was emerging as Australia’s newest star, Ellie Carpenter and Steph Catley were at their flying wing-back best, Lydia Williams was still Australia’s No 1 goalkeeper.They were expected to win the Asian Cup in 2022. Do we feel the same way now?Australia is a very different team to what they were the last time they competed for this trophy. Their fundamental core has shifted. Injuries and retirements have forced the side to figure out the next version of themselves, and nobody is quite sure what it looks like yet.Partly because the past 12 months under interim coach Tom Sermanni, the last coach to win this tournament for Australia back in 2010, was a year of stasis. With Football Australia taking far too long to appoint a successor to Tony Gustavsson, the team wasted several windows trotting out their tired senior players for friendlies when they should have been blooding the next generation instead.So who are the Matildas now? They’ve lost some older players, gained some newer ones. The form of some key figureheads – Kerr, Fowler, Katrina Gorry – remains uncertain. The team’s recent performances haven’t been convincing. Are they any better or any worse than they were four years ago? Just how quickly has Asia improved around them?Joe Montemurro, who took charge of his first camp earlier this month, now has just three windows left to figure it out. And they will have the hot spotlight of the nation upon them as they try to solve their past problems against the hardest group of the tournament.Their opening match against the Philippines in Perth on 1 March may seem like an easy one on paper. Australia have won all their previous matches, including an 8-0 drubbing in October 2023.But this is a nation with a plan: led by Australian Mark Torcaso, the Filipinas are full of international diaspora, particularly from the USA college system. Their gallant World Cup performances, an ever-improving youth pipeline, and a large fan community could prove trickier than anticipated.Iran, too – the lowest-ranked side in the group – are no push-overs. While the Matildas have met them just once, Iran defended brilliantly and kept them to just a 2-0 win. Their defeat of rising Asian nation, Jordan, in the final round of qualifiers shows a side steadily improving, and knowing Australia’s age-old struggle to break down deep-lying defensive teams, could pose a problem.But it’s South Korea that will cause the most concern. Never mind that the Matildas defeated them in two friendlies back in April; tournament football is a different fight, and South Korea, who reached the final in 2022 before losing to China, know how to grind through them. The shadow of India will stretch across this must-win group game.South Korea is also a nation that is moving on. Just three of their most recent call-ups have had over 100 caps, while half their current squad is aged below 25. That includes 21-year-old striker Jeon Yu-Gyeong, who stood alongside the 34-year-old Yallop on stage at last night’s draw. Two players representing two very different moments for their national teams.Australia aren’t without their glimpses of the future, though. Amy Sayer, Winonah Heatley, Teagan Micah, Charlie Grant, Jamilla Rankin and Holly McNamara have all begun to show their qualities in the vacuum of senior stars.And squad depth – as we’ve seen in the recent Women’s Euro – could be critical to topping the group, thus avoiding some of Asia’s biggest nations until World Cup qualification (which this tournament doubles as for the final time) is secured in the semi-finals.But with time slipping away and the Matildas’ older core needing to reintegrate following a period of directionless wandering, is there enough time to do what needs to be done?Next year’s Asian Cup will be a lot of things. A television spectacle, a commercial achievement, a moment in sporting history. It will also be a crucial litmus test; a chance to see just how far the Matildas have come – or, if the ghosts of their past still haunt them, how much further they have to go.",

    "content": "Maëva Squiban from Brittany won stage six of the Tour de France Femmes after a 32km breakaway through the forestclimbs of the Livradois-Forez national park to Ambert. The 23-year-old held off the pursuing peloton of favourites on the final climb to claim the biggest win of her career and the second stage win for a French rider since the women’s race was rebooted as the Tour de France Femmes in 2022.Squiban, riding for UAE Team ADQ, attacked alone, three kilometres from the top of the Col du Chansert, and maintained her lead on the fast descent, through the bonus sprint and into the finishing straight on the Boulevard Henri IV.“When they told me I had a minute and a half [lead] I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “I mainly wanted to get a head start before the climb to the bonus sprint. Then I was hoping to be part of a small group from the bonus sprint to the finish.”Behind her, Kim Le Court was as good as her word at the bonus sprints and made every second count. The Mauritian took another four seconds, just ahead of the defending champion, Kasia Niewiadoma, to extend her overall lead. “The goal was to control the race, and then see if the legs were there,” she said. “After that, it was to take the remaining bonus seconds, as there was already a rider up ahead.”“We tried to close the gap to Squiban to try and get the stage, but it wasn’t going to happen so tried to get a bit more time at the finish. I couldn’t wish for it to be better, apart from maybe winning the stage.”The 29-year-old leads by 26 seconds from Pauline Ferrand-Prévot and by 30 seconds from Niewiadoma, who leap-frogged the pre-race favourite, Demi Vollering, into third place.The first mountain stage included 2,475m of altitude gain over four categorised climbs, including the first category Col du Beal, and provoked significant time gaps. Marianne Vos tumbled down the yellow jersey rankings, dropping from sixth to 29th.Although the rest of the favourites stayed together over the top of the 10km climb, Cédrine Kerbaol and Niewiadoma tried their hand on the descent, but were recaptured at the foot of the Col du Chansert, the platform for Squiban’s solo attack.Vollering’s FDJ-Suez team-mate Juliette Labous set off in pursuit in the closing kilometres, but it was not enough to draw out any initiatives from the main challengers.Ferrand-Prévot, gold medallist in Olympic mountain biking, has been a discreet presencesince showing an explosive acceleration on stage one. Her stealthy performance is fuelling French hopes that she may break the nation’s 40-year Tour de France drought.The apparent anxieties from the FDJ-Suez team manager, Stephen Delcourt, over Vollering’s chances may be heightened by the prospect of a French rider being guided to overall victory by his nemesis, Visma–Lease a Bike’s Jos Van Emden, although the pair now appear to have ended their public feud.Friday’s stage from Bourg-en-Bresse to Chambéry has less altitude gain, but is expected to inflict yet more pain as it crosses the summit of the 1,134m Col du Granier, 17km from the finish. With three mountain stages still to come, 132 of 154 starters remain in the race.",

    "content": "Before her responsibilities were effectively cut in half, Laura Kane was burdened with the most challenging role in football, spanning everything that was hard and controversial about managing the game. Much of the criticism she copped should have been directed at the people she was directly managing, as well as the people who hired her.Greg Swann’s arrival at AFL House last Monday came with a sigh of relief. “Swanny’s a ripper” and “Swanny understands clubland” must have been uttered dozens of times on radio, on podcasts and TV this past week. But even with a fraction of Kane’s responsibilities, it remains one of the most demanding jobs in football. Swann is phlegmatic, he’s a pragmatist and (so far) he’s refreshingly free of weasel corporate-speak. Here are a few areas where he can make his mark.1. Improve the standard of umpiringAs football has become more professional, the umpiring department has not followed suit. There’s never been more umpires on the field, there’s never been more scrutiny on them, and there’s never been more for them to do. Everything is magnified now. We’re watching every game live, on large, high-definition televisions. Every game is replayed to within an inch of itself. But it’s still officiated by part-timers who are barristers, accountants, teachers and public servants. There are clearly issues around depth, and the gap between the best and worst umpires is widening. They need to be better supported, paid, trained, instructed and led. It’s one of the most critical issues the game faces.2. Simplify and clarify the rulesThis is related to the first point. Umpires have to interpret and implement ever-changing and incomprehensible laws. The holding the ball rule is a mess. Ruck free kicks are bewildering. And there are 19 elements of the “stand” rule the poor buggers have to factor in. Swann was hired for his decisiveness and his ability to cut through red tape and he needs to prove his worth here.3. Shorten the gamesSwann was still in his Brisbane polo top when he lamented the length of games. Right now, the quarters are about four minutes too long. The average match length has increased by seven minutes over the past decade, and is up by more than two minutes on last season. There’s lots of fat to trim. A good starting point would be to no longer wait for lumbering ruckmen to arrive to throw ups, and to not call for a score review every five minutes. On that note …4. Fix the score review systemIt has affected finals games. It has cost teams top-eight spots. It has made goal umpires second guess themselves. And it sucks the air out of games. It would work, maybe, if it was used as sparingly as possible. It would work, maybe, if the technology was evenly remotely up to the task. Either invest in proper technology and have proper processes, or don’t use it at all.5. Give Ken Hinkley his 20 grand backIn a league prone to punishing the most piddling of offences, Hinkley’s $20,000 fine stands out. As his career at Port Adelaide draws to a close, it would be an easy and appropriate act of goodwill to hand it back. For the “won’t someone think of the children” crowd, your child is going to see far more offensive things in every ad break – imbeciles on betting ads, stuffing their face with fried chicken and hocking secondhand goods. Compared with that, Hinkley looked positively statesmanlike. While vaguely on topic, surely Swann and the AFL could give a second thought to the five-year ban for the bloke who sent the text message to Michael Voss? Surely five years is overkill for a stupid but harmless text message. This is an extract from Guardian Australia’s free weekly AFL email, From the Pocket.

    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nLaura Kane's role as head of football was extremely challenging and often drew unfair criticism, but her responsibilities have since been reduced. Greg Swann has taken on a significant portion of Kane's former role and faces a demanding job, but has the potential to make a positive impact. One area where Swann can make a mark is improving the standard of umpiring, which has not kept pace with the increasing professionalism of the game.",

GSK did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca declined to comment.Pfizer said: “Pfizer is working closely with the Trump administration and Congress on solutions that will increase access and affordability for American patients and enhance the power of the biopharmaceutical innovation ecosystem in the United States. Our discussions have been productive.”Shares in Pfizer slipped 2%, AstraZeneca fell 3.8% and GSK dropped 3.9% during afternoon trading in New York.At the heart of of Trump’s proposal is a status known as “Most Favored Nation”, through which he wants to bind the cost of medications sold in the US to the lowest prices paid elsewhere.The White House is demanding that pharmaceutical companies extend this to drugs used by older people through the government-backed Medicaid health program, as well as new drugs.",

    "content": "Queensland’s Productivity Commission has flagged a broad construction industry “reset” that could threaten existing enterprise bargaining agreements, arguing it may be required if the state is to build its way out of a housing crisis – and host the Olympics.The commission released an interim report on Thursday into improving productivity in the construction sector that called on the Queensland government to permanently remove so-called “Best Practice Industry Conditions” (BPICs) from its procurement policy.Adopted under the previous Labor government in 2018, BPICs outlined construction union workers’ pay and conditions for all major state projects. Union proponents claim BPICs improved safety and lifted standards and created apprenticeship opportunities for women and Indigenous workers – industry opponents complained it led to cost blowouts and worksite shutdowns.: AU Breaking News emailThe Liberal National party deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, hit pause on BPICs in November until the re-established Productivity Commission completed its building industry review.But the interim recommendations of that review go beyond a call to permanently scrap BPICs – arguing “a broader industry reset” was required if Queensland was to “meet the needs of its growing population, match infrastructure commitments and deliver the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games”.The report cited industry stakeholders as blaming BPICs for a “a significant slowdown in site productivity on public construction” workplaces that had enabled similar conditions to “creep into the private sector through the rollout of BPICs-like conditions in [EBAs)]”.“Removing BPICs alone is unlikely to be sufficient to shift construction productivity to a growth path or improve behaviours on government construction sites,” the commission wrote.“Given that BPIC-like conditions now seem to be embedded in industry practice, including in enterprise bargaining agreements that are not due to be re-negotiated until mid-2027, it is likely that a broader industry reset is required.”Asked at a press conference after the release of the interim report if the LNP would permanently scrap BPICs, the treasurer, David Janetzki, said he would wait for the final report before making any announcements.However, the treasurer said that declining productivity “cannot be tolerated”.The Queensland Council of Unions denies that BPICs affected worksite productivity.In May it released a report it commissioned from University of Queensland emeritus professor of economics John Mangan that found post-Covid cost increases were primarily driven by global supply chain constraints and material shortages – not labour agreements or public procurement standards.The QCU general secretary, Jacqueline King, said at the time that BPICs “did not drive up costs or damage productivity” but improved safety, lifted standards and created real opportunities for apprentices, women and Indigenous workers.King said the commission’s interim report “missed the boat on the most important thing of all: people”.The union secretary said “any serious conversation about lifting productivity” in the construction industry had to start with fixing what she said was a “crisis in building and retaining a Queensland workforce”.“There’s no shortage of Queenslanders willing to work in construction but this is an industry stuck in the 1970s, with 55-hour weeks, inflexible work arrangements and poor workplace cultures driving people away,” King said.“If we are serious about addressing the skills shortage and building the housing and infrastructure we need for our ever growing population in the lead-up to 2032 and beyond, we need to focus on how to attract a homegrown labour force instead of migrant workers.”The peak national body for construction and infrastructure contracting companies backed the interim report as supporting “many of the reforms the industry has long been calling for”, including scrapping BPICs.“Queensland has a once-in-a-generation infrastructure task ahead,” the Australian Constructors Association chief executive, Jon Davies, said. “This report confirms the need for urgent reform and gives us a clear roadmap to get started”.The LNP is also pushing legislation to override more than a dozen planning laws – including heritage and environment protection laws – to build a swathe of venues for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games.",

The report recommends permanently removing the \"Best Practice Industry Conditions\" (BPICs) policy, which sets pay and conditions for union workers on major state projects.

    "published": "2025-07-29T14:47:24+00:00",
    "content": "It was an opportunity for Sir Pascal Soriot, as chief executive of AstraZeneca, the UK’s finest pharmaceutical firm, to kill the story stone dead if he wished. Does he want to move the company’s stock market listing to the US, as reported by the Times a few weeks ago? He declined to answer. Then he did something else: he turned his press conference after Tuesday’s half-year numbers into a declaration of love, more or less, for all things American.“The US is the country in our industry where innovation is taking place,” he said, noting that half the group’s sales will be in the US by 2030. The new multibillion-dollar manufacturing facility in Virginia – part of a $50bn investment in the US over the next five years – had progressed to signoff in 33 days. The US administration is considering AstraZeneca’s proposals for reducing medicine prices for Americans. “We are a very American company,” said the French-Australian Soriot at one point, name-checking his various American senior colleagues.True, he also said AstraZeneca is “committed” to the UK, but he was referring directly to sites such as the £1bn research and development in Cambridge, rather than the stock market listing. An analysis followed on the failings of Europe, the UK included, versus the US and China in terms of backing pharmaceutical innovation. The US invests 0.8% of its GDP in the sector, he said, versus 0.3% in Europe. He wished the UK could aim for 0.5%, and then 0.6%, to provide a bit of competition.What to make of this (clearly) preplanned response? One could shrug and say any chief executive of a globally active pharmaceutical company would be foolish not to sing the praises of the US at a moment when its president is throwing tariffs around and has steep local drug prices in his sights. Shifting investment to the US makes sense in that context. Also, Soriot’s grumbles about Europe are not new. The specific frustrations with the UK flow from the price the NHS pays for prescription medicines plus the value-for-money rules that are applied to new drugs. Most pharma companies make similar noises on that score.Yet the stock market listing – the bit Soriot left hanging in the air – is the new angle here. It would have been a simple matter for him to say, as many other large FTSE 100 companies with large US operations do, that there is no tension between a London listing and an increased operational focus state-side. But he didn’t.The government should take note. A relisting would be expensive for AstraZeneca if it included a redomicile (and, otherwise, what’s the point?), but ministers cannot rule it out, or just assume Soriot is making a power-play as part of the industry-wide negotiations on medicine prices. The stakes here are too high for complacency. A defection by the UK’s largest quoted company would blow a hole in two government missions: firstly to inject life into the London stock market, and secondly to make the UK a “life sciences superpower”.Unfortunately, the government is also starting on the back foot with AstraZeneca after the fiasco with the £450m Speke vaccine plant in Liverpool. Accounts are disputed but the most plausible reading is that the company lost patience after the Treasury tried to shave a few million quid off the support package agreed under the last government. Whatever the details, the result was for a terrible own-goal for a “pro-growth” government.The government’s other difficulty is the lack of cash to throw at NHS medicines, the factor that may persuade Soriot to start talking enthusiastically about AstraZeneca’s British roots once again. One hopes political cogs are turning behind the scenes because something has to give. If Soriot still isn’t committing publicly to the UK listing in six months’ time, there is a big problem.",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the news article:\n\nAstraZeneca CEO Sir Pascal Soriot declined to comment on rumors that the company may move its stock market listing to the US, but instead expressed his admiration for the US market, citing its innovative spirit and significant investment in the pharmaceutical sector. Soriot highlighted AstraZeneca's growing presence in the US, including a new $50bn investment over five years, and noted that half of the company's sales are expected to come from the US by 2030. While Soriot stated that AstraZeneca is \"committed\" to the UK, his comments sparked speculation about a potential US listing.",

    "content": "Rolls-Royce has reported a 50% rise in half-year profits as strong demand for its jet engines and power generators for AI datacentres solidified its turnaround efforts.The British jet-engine maker said underlying operating profits climbed to £1.7bn in the first six months of 2025, from £1.1bn during the same period last year, in an earnings update that pushed the company’s shares to a fresh all-time high, and helped push the FTSE 100 share index to a new peak too.The strong half-year results meant the manufacturer, whose main operations are in Derby, was able to raise its profit forecast for the year from a range of £2.7bn-£2.9bn to £3.1bn-£3.2bn.Rolls-Royce, which makes engines used in large Boeing and Airbus planes, said its earnings were driven in part by strong demand for its large engines business. It has also been helped by the boom in weapons spending since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Rolls-Royce a key supplier of engines for fighter jets.Its power systems business had a significant increase in interest from datacentres, which the chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgiç, confirmed was linked to the boom in artificial intelligence.Orders for datacentres rose by 85% compared with last year. The company expects a 20% increase in datacentre orders every year to 2030, having forecast annual growth of 15-17% as recently as February.The results helped propel Rolls-Royce’s shares up 10.5% on Thursday morning to a record high of £11.085, driving the company’s valuation above £90bn for the first time. In October 2020, the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, its share price fell below 40p.Its valuation has nearly doubled during 2025 and it is the fifth most valuable company on the London Stock Exchange. Rolls-Royce’s rally helped to power the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares to a record intraday high of 9,190 points on Thursday morning.The company’s turnaround has been a triumph for Erginbilgiç, who ruffled feathers on taking over the business in 2023 by saying it was on a “burning platform”.Since then he has cut costs and pushed customers to pay more for its products through renegotiating contracts for maintaining jet engines that go on wide-body planes such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787.The company received a recent boost from the UK government’s decision to choose it to deliver the first small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) – factory-produced nuclear power stations that aim to cut costs.Rolls-Royce said the SMR business, which it hopes could eventually be bigger than the existing revenues, should be “profitable and free cashflow positive by 2030”, before delivery of the first SMRs a couple of years later.",

    "content": "Keir Starmer has warned businesses who persistently delay payments to their suppliers that it is “time to pay up” as the government prepares to impose fines and penalties on repeat offenders.In what Labour has billed as the toughest crackdown on late payments in a generation, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, will say on Thursday that the changes will slash a cost to the economy that has escalated to £11bn a year.As many as 38 businesses shut down each day partly owing to late payments, the government said, hurting tradespeople, shopkeepers, startup founders and family-run firms.The planned changes will include handing the small business commissioner powers to impose fines, potentially worth millions of pounds. Established in 2016 to tackle late payments, the watchdog will also be able to carry out spot checks, verify claims and impose deadlines to clear a backlog of disputes.As part of a wider Labour drive to provide more support for small businesses, Reynolds will also announce startup loans for 69,000 companies worth £4bn “to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners”.The move is backed by the prime minister and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is keen to focus on rebooting the economy after two consecutive months of negative growth and mounting speculation about tax rises.According to the Office for National Statistics, the economy contracted by 0.1% in May after a 0.3% monthly fall in April.Sir Keir said it was important for the government to support small- and medium-sized firms, which employ 60% of the workforce and generate £2.8tn in turnover.“From builders and electricians to freelance designers and manufacturers, too many hardworking people are being forced to spend precious hours chasing payments instead of doing what they do best, growing their businesses.“It’s unfair, it’s exhausting and it’s holding Britain back. So, our message is clear: it’s time to pay up.”Reynolds is expected to say legislation will include maximum payment terms of 60 days before a reduction after an introductory period to 45 days, “giving firms certainty they’ll be paid on time”.Ministers said last September that they would consult businesses about the most effective way to tackle a “culture of late payment” after several attempts by previous Tory administrations to toughen existing codes of conduct.Reynolds will say new laws were needed to give the commissioner extra powers and force large companies to be more transparent about how they pay subcontractors and suppliers.As part of the plan, audit committees will be required to scrutinise payment practices at board level, “placing greater pressure on large firms to show they’re treating small suppliers fairly backed by mandatory interest charges for those who pay late”.The small business minister, Gareth Thomas, said: “I hear all too often about businesses who just don’t have the cash needed to start up or grow. Today, we’ve announced measures as part of our plan for change to tackle all of those issues and beyond.”",
    "summary": "Here is a 3-sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe UK government plans to impose fines and penalties on businesses that consistently delay payments to their suppliers, with the aim of tackling the £11bn annual cost to the economy.

    "content": "There’s Trump Mobile, $Trump coins, Trump watches, Trump sneakers and now … the Trump baby savings accounts! Will it be popular? As a financial adviser, I’m not so sure.The Trump IRA (or individual retirement account) was established as a part of the recently passed “big, beautiful bill” and aims to help young people save. Parents and employers can annually contribute up to $5,000 into an account for their kids who are under the age of 18. Within limits, the contributions are not taxed to the employee and employers even receive a deduction.What’s nice about these accounts is that the income earned as the account grows (hopefully) is also not taxed. And, different from a typical IRA, which penalizes early withdrawals, once the child hits 18 they can withdraw the funds without any penalties. The biggest bonus? For kids born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028, the government will kick in $1,000 to get things rolling.A thousand bucks? For free? Sounds good. And if you had a child this year, take advantage. Take the grand. Let it grow tax-free. At 5% interest it would be worth about $2,400 18 years from now. Why not?But that’s all I’d do. Why? Because if your intention is to save money for your kids, there’s at least two other strategies that make more sense.One is to lean into after-tax accounts like 529s and Roths.With a 529 account, you can put as much money away for your kids as you want into this after-tax account (be careful of gift tax limitations) and it will grow tax-free until the money is withdrawn. The catch is that the money has to be used for educational costs (tuition, books, fees, etc) at colleges and trade and vocational schools as well as private and religious schools. The new bill now also allows withdrawals to pay for professional certifications such as HVAC or plumbing licensing renewal courses.You can also set up a custodial Roth IRA for your child if they’re under 18. One caveat is that the child does have to have actual income (not interest or investment income) from a W-2 wage. Contributions are limited to $7,000 this year and do not reduce taxes. But all earnings are tax-free and savings can be withdrawn at any time.529s and Roths are good strategies if the goal is to pay for education or put money away for your child’s long-term future. But the strategy that I really love? Insurance. Thanks to the advice from a great insurance adviser 30 years ago, I bought whole life insurance policies for my kids. Why?The Trump IRA has nice intentions but c’mon … it’s really just a $1,000 political giveawayBecause by naming them as both the insured and the beneficiary on their policy and then paying the bill, I locked them into insanely low premiums that continue on to this day. For example, even today a $100,000 whole life policy for a newborn might cost about $30 a month. At age 30, the same policy might cost $150 a month.Buying a whole life policy for your kids also gets them tax-free payouts for their families one day if anything – God forbid – happens to them. It also builds up cash over time. A $50,000 policy bought at age five could have $20,000-plus in cash value by age 45.There are more benefits to doing this. Many policies pay dividends each year, which can provide income to the owner. And, different than a 529 plan, you can borrow against a whole life insurance policy without potentially interrupting its benefits or cash buildup as long as you continue to pay the premiums. I have some clients who buy these policies because – in most cases – it can guarantee the ability to get more insurance in the future even if there are health issues.Of course, these are just my opinions based on what I recommend to clients and what has been recommended to me. Your circumstances may be different. So run these numbers – and strategies – by your financial adviser and tailor it to your situation.The Trump IRA has nice intentions but c’mon … it’s really just a $1,000 political giveaway that at best will provide beer money for a kid once they hit 18. Sure, take it. But parents can realize a much better return on their investment by putting money away for their kids’ future education, retirement or – sorry to say – death. Do this instead of the Trump IRA and your children – and their future families – will be thanking you more.",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe \"Trump baby savings accounts\", also known as Trump IRAs, are a new type of savings account aimed at helping young people save for their future.

    "published": "2025-07-17T09:26:17+00:00",
    "content": "“There was a period of remorse and apology for banks and I think that period needs to be over.” So said Bob Diamond, the eight-figure-earning Barclays chief executive more than a decade ago.“We need our banks willing to take risks, to be confident and to work with the private sector in the UK to create jobs and improve economic growth.”Back in 2011, with the wounds still fresh from the worst financial collapse in a century, there were howls of outrage and anger in UK political circles over the American’s choice of words.Time though, is clearly a healer. Had Diamond waited 14 years, presumably the response in Westminster today would be a nod of agreement.Keir Starmer’s government has embraced the City, seeing the Square Mile as a ticket to faster economic growth. It is not natural territory for Labour – but with a faltering economy, a febrile bond market to keep onside, and tight constraints on tax and spending, needs must.This month, Rachel Reeves could have been channelling Diamond in her Mansion House address. The clean-up job after the crash had gone “too far in seeking to eliminate risk”, the chancellor said. Regulation was a “boot on the neck of business” that needed lifting.The message certainly landed with the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, who met Reeves in 11 Downing Street last week. “I’m encouraged,” he told Sky. However, the head of the bank, which was once described as the “Vampire Squid”, warned the government still needed to be careful on tax and regulation. Other senior bankers, including the head of Lloyds Banking Group, have followed suit.Almost two decades on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the multibillion-pound UK taxpayer bailouts, memories of the 2008 crash are wearing increasingly thin. The banks have regrouped, and scent a Labour government prepared to consider the period of remorse is now over.To some extent, the vibe shift is justified.Britain’s biggest banks have built up significantly more capital to guard against financial shocks, have exited riskier lines of business, and City rulebooks stretching to thousands of pages are in place. Lawmakers elsewhere are considering whether risk aversion has gone too far – including in the EU, after the Draghi report.Could years of nugatory growth post 2008 be linked to overregulation? The Treasury is willing to consider the connection. For years the priority was ending “too big to fail”. Now safety limits are viewed as a millstone around the neck of the City golden goose, complicated further by Brexit trashing London’s prized status as a world-beating financial centre.It is clear to see why there is appeal in boosting the City. Britain has serious comparative advantages; London has been a global trading hub for centuries, with the legacy of empire giving it the prime spot on the meridian and use of the English language and legal system worldwide. Top universities and a vibrant startup culture help further.Financial services contribute £200bn to the economy and 5% of all tax receipts, employing more than a million people – two-thirds of whom work outside London in big regional financial centres such as Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester and Belfast. It is no coincidence Reeves describes her big bang 2.0 plan as the “Leeds Reforms” to make this point. Finance is more than just the City.The chancellor is right that a strong economy needs financing. The drying up of liquidity after the 2008 crash – when banks cut back on lending to focus on repairing their balance sheets – showed what happens when borrowing is harder for households and businesses.However, hosting an oversize financial centre with assets worth £27tn – 10 times the value of everything produced in the UK each year – has serious risks. Labour ought to know this better than most, having been on the hook in government the last time the music stopped.The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, remembers – having led the central bank’s recovery operations during the 2008 crisis. Lest we forget, he warned the Treasury committee last week: “There isn’t a trade-off between financial stability and growth. We’ve had that experience.”Back then, taxpayer guarantees worth more than £1tn were required to stop the banking collapse turning into a second Great Depression. Still, the damage was monumental: millions of businesses failed, unemployment hit 2.7 million, tens of thousands of homes were repossessed.Alongside the obvious financial stability risks for a small, open economy, the reinflation of the banking industry could also hurt the government’s other priority sectors if handled poorly.Alongside finance in the government’s industrial strategy there are seven other sectors: advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, defence, digital, life sciences, and professional services. All need access to growth capital, and so a strong banking sector makes sense on paper. In practice, however, there is a risk the banks use their newfound freedoms to pump more money into speculative or overseas activities.The lesson from history are not particularly encouraging.Before the 2008 crash, banks were heavily criticised for prioritising speculative activity over lending for the production of goods and services; contributing to the inflation of the biggest property market bubble in history.Mortgages still account for more than half of all UK bank lending, whereas outstanding credit to non-financial corporations – and for manufacturing in particular – is worth a pittance in comparison.Hosting mega banks servicing the needs of global investors and corporates brings valuable flows of capital into Britain, sustaining jobs and wealth creation. But there are two-sides to the coin: since the 1980s big bang Britain has suffered from a “finance curse”, or Dutch disease, as the banking sector exploded beyond a useful size for the rest of the domestic economy, crowding out other activity and stoking inequality.The danger of relying on banks to do the heavy lifting on economic growth is best summed up by the US financial sage Warren Buffett’s observation : “We were promised that a rising tide would lift all boats. [Instead] a rising tide has lifted all yachts.” For the chancellor, a City big bang is only advisable with enough checks and balances to ensure the same does not happen again.The period of remorse might be over. But 2008 should not be forgotten.",

    "content": "The governor of the Bank of England blocked a meeting that Rachel Reeves tried to secure with watchdogs and Revolut, amid concerns the chancellor was meddling in an independent process over the fintech’s UK banking licence.Andrew Bailey intervened after learning of the plan to bring together representatives from Revolut, the Treasury and the Bank’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, to discuss the fintech’s ambitions to become a fully authorised UK bank.The three-way meeting, first reported by the Financial Times, had been due to take place in the past few weeks but was cancelled over concerns that the central bank’s regulatory decisions should be independent from government interventions and influence.A Treasury spokesperson said: “The chancellor and the governor have a strong and productive relationship, and the government fully supports the operational independence of the Bank of England.”The Bank declined to comment.The meeting would have been part of the government’s charm offensive, with ministers desperate to convince Revolut – last estimated to be worth $45bn (£33.6bn) – to choose London for its much-awaited stock market debut primary listing.Ministers have been spooked by comments from Revolut’s co-founder and chief executive, Nik Storonsky, who suggested last December that New York could be a better fit because of the regulatory environment and the size of the market.Losing Revolut, which is Europe’s most valuable private fintech, would represent a major blow to the City and the London Stock Exchange, which has suffered from a growing number of defections, with companies snubbing the UK for listings abroad.The chancellor has also been urging UK watchdogs to support financial firms in the name of growth, having gone so far as to claim in her Mansion House speech this month that regulation was acting as a “boot on the neck” of businesses.Revolut secured a limited UK banking licence last year after a rare three-year wait, having had to convince regulators it had addressed a number of accounting issues and EU regulatory breaches, as well as reputational concerns, including about an overaggressive corporate culture. The fintech company says it has since resolved those accounting and regulatory problems, and has made efforts to improve its working culture.However, the fintech was only granted a restricted licence and, 12 months on, has yet to have its application fully authorised.The restrictions mean it cannot currently offer its own loans in the UK, and while it can hold customer deposits, they are capped at £50,000. Banks are usually put under these restrictions until they can prove they have appropriate staff, IT systems and governance and accountability checks in place to satisfy officials.Revolut has been hoping to gain full approval from UK regulators this year. A fully fledged licence would open the door to new income streams, allowing it to start funding own-branded loans and mortgages.It would also mean it would face stricter regulations and make it part of the compensation scheme.A full licence was expected to be the first step in opening the door to banking licences in other countries, including the US. Revolut has already secured an EU banking licence through Lithuania.In the absence of UK approval, it has emerged that Revolut is considering buying an American bank in order to secure an American banking licence and accelerate its expansion stateside.The fintech company originally launched as a prepaid card focused on free currency exchange for customers. It has since grown to more than 10,000 staff, serving customers in more than 36 countries, with more than 50 products and services. As well as money transfers, it offers home rentals, buy now, pay later credit, wage advances, e-sims for mobile data plans and crypto trading.Its annual report in April showed Revolut more than doubled its annual profits in 2024, jumping almost 150% to £1bn, thanks to a rise in subscriptions, and revenues from its wealth and crypto trading divisions.",
    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the article:\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, blocked a meeting between UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves, regulators, and fintech company Revolut over concerns of government meddling in the independent regulatory process. The meeting was intended to discuss Revolut's bid for a UK banking license, but the Bank of England intervened to maintain its independence. The move comes as the UK government tries to persuade Revolut, valued at $45bn, to choose London for its stock market debut.",

    "content": "Turbo Tufan strikes again. It’s almost becoming predictable. Every time Tufan Erginbilgiç, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, sets “midterm” financial targets, the aero-engine maker beats them, or looks set to do so, in no time.Back in February, Erginbilgiç was able to declare that the 2027 targets for operating profits would be hit two years early, so he set new ambitions for 2028. Six months on, even the refreshed numbers look conservative. After a strong first-half, Rolls now thinks it will make £3.1bn-£3.2bn of operating profit over the whole of 2025, or about £300m more than previously advertised. At the current rate of rapid progress, it looks a short hop to £3.6bn-£3.9bn in 2028.The shares rose 8% and touched £11 for the first time. Three years ago the price was about £1. A business that required a £2bn rescue rights issue in the pre-vaccine depths of the pandemic in 2020, is now the fifth largest company in the FTSE 100 index and valued at £90bn.Naturally, Erginbilgiç’s share-based “golden hello” has followed in lock-step. To lure him from the private equity sector, he got £7.5m-worth of Rolls shares when they were 91p in January 2023. That package is now worth a cool £90m, albeit locked up in tranches until 2027 and 2028 (a reassuring detail from the point of view of shareholders).The story of how it has been done is well known by now, even if the pace continues to surprise. Erginbilgiç reorganised Rolls’ top management, removed a layer of costs, culled wasteful sidelines and, critically, invested in the reliability of the engines to allow a “win-win” renegotiation of contracts with airlines. Rolls, a company famed for years for falling short on cash generation, is now churning out the stuff.Meanwhile, markets everywhere are helpful. Demand for civil engines has fully recovered from the pandemic. The Aukus submarine partnership, where Rolls supplies the propulsion systems, underpinned the defence side even before Nato governments pledged to spend more on heavy equipment. Even the unloved power systems division has been knocked into shape in time for the age of datacentres that require backup generators.So the next question is whether the news can get any better. Can Erginbilgiç possibly maintain the pace?Well, there are two reasons to take seriously his talk about “substantial growth prospects beyond the midterm”. One is the bet on small modular reactors, or SMRs. It is still early days but the UK has ordered three and the Czech Republic six, so we will eventually discover whether these scaled-down nuclear plants can be built on time and on budget. If the answer is yes, then possibilities open up. Like the Czechs, the rest of eastern and central Europe probably wants a cost-efficient alternative to Russian gas. Power-hungry “hyperscale” datacentres in the US represent another set of potential customers.The SMR unit will be “profitable and cashflow positive by 2030”, said Erginbilgiç. Before that date, we may be asking what the operation would be worth as a spunoff, separately listed company – Rolls has a 62% stake at the moment.The other potential biggie is engines for narrow-body aircraft. Rolls is currently exclusively widebody, but its UltraFan development engine is intended to be capable of being adapted for both markets. The enormous costs mean Rolls would need a partner (the City’s guess is Pratt & Whitney), a committed airline customer and would probably demand government support. But the narrow market is much larger than the wide one – it could be genuinely transformative for Rolls.A cynical view says something always goes wrong at Rolls sooner or later, which was the experience over a couple of decades of false dawns. If there is a difference this time, it is that the company is finally producing heaps of cash, which is the real measure of success in its business. Don’t mess it up: the UK engineering sector needs a reliable world-leader.",

Erginbilgiç's successful turnaround of the company has also led to a substantial increase in the value of his share-based \"golden hello\" package, now worth £90m.",

All this could mitigate ageing’s drag on growth.”Treasury’s intergenerational reports have increasingly focused the minds of Australians on the budget implications of an ageing population.As useful as these reports have been to inform the current debate around taxation reform, they may also have fed a narrative of drooling oldies who need to be propped through their autumn years by vibrant and athletic under-50s.If the IMF is right, that trite adage that “demography is destiny” is, to a large degree, wrong.As ever, our destiny is what we make of it.",

However, a recent International Monetary Fund study found that 70-year-olds today have similar cognitive health scores to 53-year-olds in 2000, indicating that age is no longer a barrier to work. To capitalize on this trend, policymakers and employers need to adopt a more inclusive approach to older workers.",

    "content": "The reason why we don’t have free dental in Medicare is because we subsidise the inheritance of the wealthiest people in Australia.I know it might shock you to see it written plainly, it might even annoy you. But it is the truth.The way superannuation is mostly covered by the media in this country is about how to avoid paying tax and how to use it to fund inheritance.Take the headline this week in Nine newspapers “money column”: “We have $8m in an SMSF. How can we avoid the new super tax?”You could hardly find a more pointed example of everything wrong with Australia’s media and economic system.I look forward to the SMH and others providing advice on how people on jobseeker can work for cash to avoid losing any benefits and paying extra tax.Similarly, it doesn’t take long for any story about the proposed changes to the tax breaks on superannuation balances over $3m to mention inheritance. That’s because $3m is so far beyond what anyone needs to retire comfortably that only the most self-delusional think they need more than that to survive. Heck, the main way Peter Dutton criticised the changes was to label them a “quasi inheritance tax”.The best one of the genre is an AFR headline: “New $3m super tax is ‘stealing my children’s inheritance’”. You might expect that from the AFR but you would hope for better from the ABC.On Tuesday night, ABC’s 7.30 reported on a pair of farmers who were worried about the changes to the superannuation tax breaks because the combined balances of the couple was $5.5m and so might soon have a combined $6m (ie more than $3m each).The 7.30 story had no mention of inheritance but the written version noted that “the money isn’t only being used to fund their retirement. The plan is for it to help fund the inheritances of their other children without necessitating selling off the family farm.”Let’s stop right there.We don’t give tax breaks on superannuation so that you can fund the inheritance of your children.Tattoo that on your eyeballs.Superannuation tax breaks are designed to encourage you to save so you do not need to rely on the age pension. It is not so your kids can get a head start in life. That might be a nice thing for you to do but there is zero public benefit in giving you a tax break to do it.The story also contained the claim by the couple’s son that “Mum and Dad will be up for an extra $120,000 a year”.According to the report, the extra tax was due to the anticipated unrealised capital gain of the farming assets (the wind turbines and the agricultural chemical businesses) once the couple’s super balance passed $6m (ie $3m each).Well now. If your Spidey senses are tingling, you should be a journalist. Because that seems a rather bold claim.Consider that to pay $120,000 in tax on just plain old income you need to earn $342,000 a year.If the graph does not display click hereGiven the average tax on that is 35.1%, we know that cannot be the case for super, because super earnings are only taxed at 15% until the balance goes above $3m and then the earnings attributable to the amount above $3m are taxed at 30% – both below 35%.So, for that claim to be true, the earnings on their superannuation (including unrealised capital gains) would need to be well over $342,000.How much? Well, the Treasury has given us a handy fact sheet that lets us work it out.For one person with a $3m super balance, their fund would need to increase by $2m for them to have to pay an extra $120,000 (yes, just a 6% tax rate).But what if the $120,000 is combined?In that case, both their funds would need to grow in a year from $3m to $4.3m. Each would pay $60,035 on that $1.3m unrealised gains. Yep, a tax rate of just 4.6% each.If the graph does not display click hereConsider as well that an ordinary income earner pays an average tax rate of 4.6% when they earn just $25,500.Those with super balances of over $3m are still getting a tax break because if it was taxed like normal income they would pay 45% tax not 30%. These tax breaks cost money. Money that the government has decided it is better to spend than, for example, to include dental in Medicare.Let’s do some maths.The cost of putting dental in Medicare, which would include “preventative and therapeutic dental services, including regular check-ups and teeth cleans, crowns, orthodontic treatment, oral surgeries, periodontics and prosthodontics” is estimated by the Parliamentary Budget Office to be $13.63bn in the first year.That is a lot of money.But not compared to how much each year the government gives in tax breaks to the richest 10% on their superannuation – most of whom will not be eligible of the age pension, and thus are getting a tax break for no public good, and much of which will go towards inheritance.In 2025-26, the Treasury estimates these breaks will cost the budget $22bn.If the graph does not display click hereWhen the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was asked about dental in Medicare during the election campaign he told reporters that “we’ve got to make sure that we can afford it and make sure there’s room for it in the budget”.OK, then. Let’s not cut all the super tax concessions for the richest 10%. Let’s still give them $8bn a year in tax breaks to help ensure they have stonks more money than they need for retirement.Great, we have now found room in the budget to pay for dental in Medicare.Dental in Medicare or tax breaks to the richest so they can give money tax-free to their kids?Budget and governing are about choices, and so too is how the media covers it.

    "summary": "Here is a 2-3 sentence summary of the news article:\n\nThe author argues that the lack of free dental care in Medicare is due to the fact that the Australian government prioritizes subsidizing the inheritance of the wealthiest individuals through superannuation tax breaks. The media often focuses on how to use superannuation to avoid taxes and fund inheritance, rather than retirement needs. This prioritization is highlighted by the media's reaction to proposed changes to tax breaks on superannuation balances over $3m, with many outlets framing them as an \"inheritance tax\".",

    "content": "Jim Chalmers has reinvigorated the economic policy debate with all the talk now about his economic reform roundtable.Unfortunately, the biggest voices invariably are those who desire to help themselves. The other problem is the debate remains bounded in purposeful obfuscation. That is why it is very pleasing to read Acoss’s new report – Taxing income less and consumption more: The case against – which factchecks some myths about Australia’s tax system.Acoss provides three points that need to be the basis of any discussion of tax.Australia is a low-taxing nationIf you can’t admit Australia is a low-taxing nation, then you should not get entry into any roundtable discussion on the topic. As Acoss notes, Australia is the ninth-lowest taxing nation across all the advanced economies in the world. We raise less tax than every nation in the G7 except for the US. We raise less tax than South Korea, Canada, Japan, or the UK.: AU Breaking News emailIn 2022 (the latest OECD-wide figures) the average level of tax across the OECD was 34% of GDP, while in Australia it was just 29.4% of GDP.If the graph does not display click hereThat’s the equivalent of an extra $128bn.And sure, you might say, “that’s how it is, we can’t change that”.But we change things all the time in our tax system. Paul Keating introduced capital gains tax, John Howard introduced a 50% capital gains tax discount and the GST. We used to have inheritance taxes, and then Joh Bjelke-Petersen got rid of them in 1977:If the graph does not display click hereWe also change our spending – we haven’t always had Medicare or the NDIS. Nothing needs to only be the way it is or was.In 1970, total government tax revenue was 20.5% of GDP; within 15 years it was 27.5% of GDP – that’s a bigger shift than to go from where we are now to the OECD average.Nothing is fixed.If the graph does not display click hereAustralia is not overly reliant on income taxThe myth that we are a big income-taxing nation refuses to die.Independent MP Allegra Spender, for example, likes to say in her social media videos and tax “green paper” that “we need to lower the tax burden on working people through lowering income taxes” because we need to rebalance “tax revenue from income taxes on labour towards other sources of tax” to ensure “sustainability”.Except, as Acoss details, we are the seventh-lowest taxer of personal income in the OECD, and the 11th lowest when you include corporate income:If the graph does not display click hereAs the Acoss report notes, Australia’s “share of personal income and social security taxes is 40%, below the OECD average of 50%”:If the graph does not display click hereAustralia is less dependent on personal income taxes than every country in the G7 and yet, apparently, we need to reduce our dependency even more.Even compared with our own history we’re not all that dependent on private income tax:If the graph does not display click hereIncreasing the GST will hurt low-middle income earnersOften talk about needing to reduce our dependency on income tax is followed by a call to increase the GST. Conservative economists like to argue a GST is the most efficient tax.Caring more about tax efficiency rather than equity is rather revealing but, even still, as Acoss notes, the GST is not actually much more efficient than income tax.They note that previous Treasury research found increasing the GST to 15% and reducing income tax to compensate “would deliver negligible GDP gains”. The difference in efficiency of income tax and GST is so small that it would barely register in the overall economy.So, the only reason you would do it is if it was fairer. But, as Acoss finds, it is decidedly not so.Around the bottom 60% of households would be worse off from an increase in the GST to 15% combined with a 5% income tax cut.If the graph does not display click hereThe government could instead increase low-income benefits but, as Acoss argues, these are notoriously temporary.They note, for example, that the GST support package included “$3 per week per child family payments … together with an increase of up to $7 per week per family for sole parent families”. That was great until “seven years later, income support for sole parents with school age children was cut by $25 per week”.So where does this leave us?The problem is not dependency on income taxes but that we have overly generous income tax breaks for those who do not need them other than for reasons that have little economic basis.As Acoss argues, “tax concessions for superannuation are excessively generous for people who don’t need support to save for retirement” and similarly “capital gains tax and negative gearing concessions encourage speculation in land, undermine housing affordability and divert investment from more productive purposes”.We don’t need to increase the GST but we could broaden it to include things like private health insurance and private school fees which would actually be progressive. Some in the private school sector are already getting antsy about this (as they should).And here’s the thing – we don’t need to only fund things with more GST – we could tax wealth and better tax gas companies and all the proceeds could go into the GST bucket that the states get.There are a lot of ways to improve the tax system but, if you can’t admit the three points above, you really should admit you don’t belong in the conversation.

    "content": "On Friday, the ATO released the annual taxation statistics. These provide the data on everyone’s 2022-23 tax returns.If you love spreadsheets, you’ll love this release – one of them has 167 columns of data on everything from how many people earned “less than $0” (110,372) to how many of those who earned more than $1m had a Hecs debt (73). It also revealed that 91 millionaires paid no tax because they were able to reduce their “taxable” income to below the tax-free threshold.But as most of you are sensible and do not love spreadsheets, let me dive into them and tell you what you need to know.Negative gearing is back in styleOne of the problems for those wishing to negative gear is that record low interest rates make this rather difficult (this might have broken the record for “most Australian-first-world problem ever written”).This was the case in 2020-21 and 2021-22 when the cash rate hit 0.1%, and for the first time since John Howard introduced the 50% capital gains tax discount, the number of rental profits exceeded rental losses. But in 2022-23 interest rates rose significantly, and as a result the rental loss numbers also rose (and profits fell):If the graph does not display click hereGiven the lag of rate rises and because some investors might have been able to fix their rates for a period, I suspect this time next year the number of rental losses will rise even more.Negative gearing remains the favourite of high-income earnersI have long joked that if you were an enterprising real estate agent, you could do a lot worse than set up camp wherever anaesthetists and surgeons were holding conferences, given they are always the most likely occupations to negative gear. And so it remains – 25.5% of surgeons negatively geared a property, while 24.9% of anaesthetists did as well.If the graph does not display click hereAlmost half of capital gains go to people earning more than $1m a yearThere has been a lot of talk this year about capital gains due to the changes to the superannuation tax concessions taxing unrealised capital gains – ie the value of assets held by a person in their super funds – of earnings in balances over $3m.But for most of us capital gains are a non-entity – most of us earn our income from our salary or wages and we get taxed at the income tax rate. Capital gains however get a 50% discount if you have owned the asset for more than a year.If that feels like a rort, well, welcome to Australia’s tax system.Ninety per cent of Australians earned less than $150,000 in total income in 2022-23. That 90% earn about 72% of all the wages and salaries in Australia, but they earn just 19% of all the capital gains in Australia.By contrast, the 24,350 people who earned more than $1m a year make up just 0.2% of all individuals in the tax system, but earned 46% of all the capital gains in Australia:If the graph does not display click hereAnd when you compare the average wages and capital gains by total income range, it’s pretty clear than the very rich get most of their income from capital gains rather than wages (as well as dividends and franking credits that come from owning shares):If the graph does not display click here$3m superannuation remains a long way away from almost everyoneSpeaking of tax dodges, the tax stats also give us the latest figures for median superannuation balance by age and gender.In 2022-23, the median superannuation balance for women in their early 60s was just $153,685, while for men it was $205,385.At this point we should note that the ASFA recommends a single person having $595,000 in super to have a “comfortable retirement”. This means more than half of people nearing retirement have only around a third of money in their super to be able to retire comfortably.ASFA also suggests that for a 32-year-old to be able to have a comfortable retirement they should now have $83,000 in their super. The median balance however for people ages 30-34 is just $38,525.It really is getting a bit silly trying to argue against the changes to the tax concessions of superannuation balances above $3m:If the graph does not display click hereIf you earn more than $150,000 you are in the top 10% – and you are probably a manThe ATO rather wonderfully breaks down the incomes of all Australians into percentiles – to let you know where you sit among the rest of all the income earners in Australia.Women are very much overrepresented in the bottom half of the income scale. There are 3.52 million women in the bottom income half, but just 2.8 million men.By contrast, at the very top 1% there are 35,315 women compared with 91,160 men.The median earnings is about $70,000. Earning more than $150,000 puts you in the top 10% – and 70% of those are men:If the graph does not display click hereThe gender pay gap remains wideWhenever we hear talk about the gender pay gap it is in either hourly or weekly terms. But this hides how many hours (or days) people actually work. If a man and woman are both earning $50 an hour, but the man gets 40 hours a week, while the woman only gets 20 hours, are we really going to say there is no gender pay gap?The ATO tax stats show all – because it records how much you earn in a year, which is pretty crucial given you have to pay bills all year round, not just the weeks you earn money.And once again the difference is stark.Take for example the most male- and female-dominated occupations, plumbers and midwives:If the table does not display click hereBut perhaps we should not be too shocked that men are paid more on average in the most female-dominated occupation, because in almost all jobs men earn more:If the graph does not display click hereWhile it might be easy to suggest that this is just the way it is, a couple of examples show how things can change.Since 2016 both women’s cricket and football (across all codes) has gained much greater visibility and support, and it is clearly present in the gender pay gap. In 2016-17, women made up just 3.3% of the 2,911 people who listed “footballer” as their main occupation; in 2022-23 it was 18% – from 96 women to 537. Similarly, women now make up 36% of the 403 professional cricketers in Australia.And while men still get paid much more than women, the closing of the gap is quite stark – and something unfathomable a decade ago.If the graph does not display click hereIt’s worth remembering that gender pay gaps – just as how incomes and wealth are taxed – are not set in stone, and things can always be made more fair.
